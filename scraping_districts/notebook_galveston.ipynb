Latitude: 30.1669        Longitude: -93.2956                                                                                Hydrologic Unit Codes: 08080206,  Calcasieu - Mermentau      CHARACTER OF WORK:   Dredging approximately 496 cu. yds of material to widen an existing canal, install 100 â€™ of bulkhead, and to construct timber walkways and a covered boat house.  The project as prop osed would directly impact  0.1 of an acre  of tidal waters.  The applicant has stated that no jurisdictional wetlands will be impacted; therefore, compensatory mitigation has not been proposed.                                                      The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality WQC will close 2 0 days  from the date of this joint public notice.  Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period.  Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant\\'s name  2  and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above,  ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality  Certification must reference the applicant\\'s name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to  the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above. Individuals or parties may  request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing or e -mailing the  Corps of Engineers Project Manager listed above. Any request must be specific and substantively  supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial  comment period. The Section Chief will review  the request and the requestor will be promptly notified  of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the  initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.    The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.  Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.   Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national co ncern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal w ill be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments receiv ed will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.           The New Orleans District is unaware of properties listed on the National Register of Historic  Places near the proposed work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or  destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. As required, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist and S tate Historic Preservation Officer  regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.                                                                       The New Orleans District has determined that the proposed activity is not likely to adversely affect the threatened West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) species based on the Information for Planning and Consultation (IPaC) system, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services Office.         Our initia l finding is that the proposed work would not affect any species, nor affect any habitat 3  designated as critical to the survival and recovery of such species, listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.     This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant\\'s proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0.1 of an acre  of EFH utilized by various  life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impact s and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.          If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Departm ent of Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications , before a permit is issued.   Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.   You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.          For Darrell S.
