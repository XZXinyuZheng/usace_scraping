PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion.

The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.

This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities.

PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities. Our final determination is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service and/or the U.S. Department of Interior, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

There is no designated critical habitat within the project action area. The USACE determination will be based on review of the Standard Local Operating Procedures for Endangered Species (SLOPES) programmatic agreement species effects determination keys for the aforementioned listed species. Coordination with the USFWS will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate.  COMMENTS :  This public notice is being distributed to all known interested persons in order to assist in developing facts on which a decision by the USACE can be based.  The Mobile District is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state and local agencies and officials; Indian tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.

Box 1632                         Robertsdale, Alabama 36567  AGENT:  Wetland Resources Environmental Consulting                 Attention:  Ms. Gena Todia                 Post Office Box 2694                 Daphne, Alabama 36526  LOCATION :  Bon Secour Bay; 10185 Pleasure Point Road; within Section 23, Township 9 South, Range 2 East; at Latitude 30.24384掳 North, Longitude -87.848961掳 West; Gulf Shores, Mobile County, Alabama.  PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities.

The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM).

HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities. Our final determination is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service and/or the U.S. Department of Interior, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities.

PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities.

PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities. Our final determination is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service and/or the U.S. Department of Interior, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities. Our final determination is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service and/or the U.S. Department of Interior, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

Box 1632                         Robertsdale, Alabama 36567  AGENT:  Wetland Resources Environmental Consulting                 Attention:  Ms. Gena Todia                 Post Office Box 2694                 Daphne, Alabama 36526  LOCATION :  Bon Secour Bay; 10185 Pleasure Point Road; within Section 23, Township 9 South, Range 2 East; at Latitude 30.24384掳 North, Longitude -87.848961掳 West; Gulf Shores, Mobile County, Alabama.  PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities. Our final determination is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service and/or the U.S. Department of Interior, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities. Our final determination is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service and/or the U.S. Department of Interior, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities.

PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities.

Please communicate this information to interested parties.  APPLICANT :  Bruce & Donna Lauser                         P.O. Box 1632                         Robertsdale, Alabama 36567  AGENT:  Wetland Resources Environmental Consulting                 Attention:  Ms. Gena Todia                 Post Office Box 2694                 Daphne, Alabama 36526  LOCATION :  Bon Secour Bay; 10185 Pleasure Point Road; within Section 23, Township 9 South, Range 2 East; at Latitude 30.24384掳 North, Longitude -87.848961掳 West; Gulf Shores, Mobile County, Alabama.  PROJECT PURPOSE :  The basic project purpose is to restore and stabilize the project shoreline to the 1997 extent and construct additional protection to prevent future erosion.  The overall project purpose is to reclaim land lost to erosion along an actively eroding shoreline, to the historic 1997 extent and provide additional stabilization and protection for the upland property.   PROPOSED WORK :  The applicant proposes the construction of a 181-linear-foot bulkhead to be located approximately 40-linear-feet waterward of the existing Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline. Approximately 150 cubic yards of commercially obtained clean sand fill will be discharged below MHW, landward of the bulkhead. Waterward of the bulkhead, approximately 215 cubic yards of riprap material would be discharged below MHW.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :   No wetlands are present within the project area. Impacts to Waters of the U.S. are being avoided and minimized by reclaiming only a portion of the private land lost to erosion. Only riprap and clean sandy fill material will be  CESAM-RD-A                                                                                                   January 6, 2023 Public Notice No. SAM-2022-00391-EAH                                                          Page 2 of 4  placed below the plane of MHT. The bulkhead will be constructed first, then sand will be placed behind it. The sand will be stabilized with sod. Riprap placed on the waterward side of the bulkhead will serve as an energy-absorbing feature that will prevent scouring and undercutting, thereby preventing bulkhead failure. Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented to prevent silt laden dredged material runoff from reentering the waterway.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, has not verified the adequacy of the applicant鈥檚 avoidance and minimization efforts at this time.  MITIGATION :  The project would not result in the permanent loss of a special aquatic site; therefore, mitigation has not been proposed.    WATER QUALITY / COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT :  The applicant has applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and for Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program.  Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and CZM consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES :  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the Mobile District has determined the permit area consists of the entire undertaking in waters of the United States as well as portions of the upland residential lot.  The National Register of Historic Places will be consulted for properties listed in or eligible for the National Register, which are known to exist and would be affected by the proposed work.  The Mobile District is seeking comment from the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding the existence, or the potential for existence, of significant cultural and historic properties within the permit area.  Coordination with the SHPO and federally-recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate. The permit area described above is currently under review by District Archaeologists to provide a determination on the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties.  ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT :  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would impact approximately 0.11 acre of unvegetated estuarine substrate utilized by various life stages of multiple marine species. No aquatic vegetation is within the footprint of the proposed activities.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities. Our final determination is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service and/or the U.S. Department of Interior, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

There is no designated critical habitat within the project action area. The USACE determination will be based on review of the Standard Local Operating Procedures for Endangered Species (SLOPES) programmatic agreement species effects determination keys for the aforementioned listed species. Coordination with the USFWS will be performed separately from this notice, as determined to be appropriate.  COMMENTS :  This public notice is being distributed to all known interested persons in order to assist in developing facts on which a decision by the USACE can be based.  The Mobile District is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state and local agencies and officials; Indian tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the USACE to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this proposal.

This public notice is being distributed to all known interested persons to assist in developing facts on which a decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) can be based. Please communicate this information to interested parties.   APPLICANTS:   Mobile County Commission     Attention: M r. Matthew Jones      205 Government Street     Mobile , Alabama 36644 -1600   AGENT:       Moffatt & Nichol s       Attention:  Ms. Meg Goecker        11 N. Water Street, Suite 20220     Mobile, Alabama 36602        LOCATION/WATERS: Bayou La Batre Canal ; 14880 City Docks Road; within Section 38, Township 8 South, Range 3 West; beginning at Latitude: 30.382791掳 North , Longitude: - 88.269094 掳 West ; Bayou La Batre, Mobile County, Alabama   PROJECT PURPOSE:  T he purpose of the project is to support the local citizens and commercial fishing industry by providing a multipurpose recreational and business development amenity for the Town of Bayou La Batre.   PROPOSED WORK:  Following the removal of existing shoreline and waterward structures within the project area, the applicant proposes the re placement of exis ting bulkhead structures within the basin, construction of a new boat ramp with revetment,  docking facilities, and a kayak launch. The project would occur within  approximately  2.2-acres of estuarine waterbottoms and result in the permanent loss of 0.17- acre of emergent wetlands. Bulkhead reconstruction will include installation of steel sheet pile bulkhead with concrete cap along 1,430 linear feet of shoreline and replacement of a 106-linear -foot bulkhead by installing steel sheet pile 36- inches waterward of the existing CESAM -RD-A                                                                                                   November 11, 2022  Public Notice No. SAM -2022- 00666- EAH                                                                     Page 2 of 4 wall. Backfill will include an estimated 4,875 cubic yards  (CY) of clean fill material to be discharged below the plane of Mean High Water (MHW). The new four  (4) lane concrete boat ramp would require the discharge of 1,920 CY of concrete and revetment stone below MHW. A 卤7,500- square-f oot (SF) shoreline revetment would be constructed along the southern edge of the basin and would include the discharge of 260 CY of clean fill and riprap material. Docking facilities  would provide one- hundred- one ( 101) open slips and would include the installation of 卤22,213 SF of floating aluminum dockage, a 卤274 SF floating fuel dock,  卤1,182 SF of floating a luminium boarding dockage, and 卤1,460 SF of floating transient  and connecting dockage. Ancillary infrastructure includes eight (8) gangways and two (2) concrete access  platforms totaling 卤216 SF. Floating dockage is anticipated to be moored with ninety -two (92) steel pipe guide piles to be 100- feet-long with approximately 33ft extending from the waterbottoms . A new 卤805 SF floating kayak launch would be moored by four steel pipe guidelines and provide two (2) launching lanes.   AVOIDANCE & MINIMIZATION:   The applicant鈥檚 submitted statement on avoidance and minimization indicates that design alternatives were considered to optimize the use of the project site  and minimize impacts to wetlands in the project area. Approximately 0.09-acre of wetlands would be avoided by the project activities.  At this time, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has not determined the adequacy of the applicant's avoidance and minimization efforts for the proposed activity.   MITIGATION:   The applicant has requested that no compensatory mitigation be required for direct impacts to 0.17- acre of emergent wetlands due to the scale of the impacts  and the condition of the impaired, disturbed wetlands.   At this time, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has not determined the adequacy of the applicant's mitigation proposal.   WATER QUALITY/COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT (CZM):   The applicant has  applied for certification from the State of Alabama in accordance with Section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, and for a consistency determination regarding Coastal Zone regulations in accordance with the Alabama Coastal Area Management Program. Upon co mpletion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to Water Quality Certification and Coastal Zone consistency will be made by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management  (ADEM).   This notice will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act.   HISTORIC PROPERTIES:  In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and Appendix C of 33 CFR Part 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect cultural and historic properties within the permit area. The USACE has determined that the permit area encompasses the entire project to occur within waters of the United States, as well as portions of the adjacent uplands that have the potential to be disturbed by those activities , including  that which would be utilized for construction access and equipment and materials staging.   CESAM -RD-A                                                                                                   November 11, 2022  Public Notice No. SAM -2022- 00666- EAH                                                                     Page 3 of 4 The USACE has not yet determined the proposed project鈥檚 effect on cultural resources or historic properties within the current Permit Area. Coordination with the SHPO  and federally -recognized American Indian tribes will be performed separately  from this notice, as determined to be appropriate.   ENDANGERED SPECIES:  Preliminary review of this application and the U.S. Department of the Interior鈥檚 List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants indicate the proposed activity may affect the West Indian manatee (T) and will have no effect on the following listed endangered or threatened species with the potential to exist within the watershed of the permit area:  wood stork (T), gopher tortoise (T), black pine snake (T), eastern indigo snake (T) , and Gulf sturgeon (T) . There is no designated critical habitat within the project action area. The above determination is based on review of the Standard Local Operating Procedures for Endangered Species (SLOPES) programmatic agreement species effects determination keys for the aforementioned listed species and is being coordinated with the USFWS via this Public Notice.   ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT:   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The proposed project would encompass  approximately 9.75- acres of non-vegetated estuarine substrate within a nd adjacent to the existing manmade basin, which includes the footprint of the shoreline protection structures, the boat ramp, and docking facilities . The discharge of fill material adjacent to the project shoreline would have the potential to affect any benthic organisms, filter feeders, and fin- fish in the immediate area. Neighboring benthic communities, filter feeders, and fin- fish within the water column would have the potential to be stressed by any migrant sediments and/or suspended particulates generated during the temporary period of construction. Due to the proposed use of turbidity barriers and the temporary nature of the activities, effects are expected to be minor and temporary, and benthic communities within the project area are  expected to repopulate rapidly. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have an adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries due to the minor area of impact and proposed mitigation activities. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigative measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
