The overall project purpose is to create a 76-slip marina, and 2 dry storage berths and auxiliary vessel launch facility associated with a v essel repair and service facility, for a total of 78 additional slips on the Foley Land Cut segment of the GIWW.     PROPOSED","The applicant proposes to construct a n “L shaped” 76 wet-slip marina on the north shore of the Foley Land Cut. The proposed work involves the mechanical dredging and excavation of approximately 28,267 cubic yards of open waterbottoms and 216,690 cubic yards of land to create a marina with water depths of -9 feet m ean lower  low water (MLLW) inside t he created marina , and -10 feet MLLW within the two entrance channels. The applicant states 56,200 cubic yards of excavated materials is expected to be dewatered and used onsite, and 188,800 cubic yards of excavated material possibly used   offsite for the renourishment of Terry Cove Islands and widening of Waterways East Boulevard by t he City of Gulf Shores. The North/South portion of the marina  basin will be approximately 400 feet wide by 582 feet long. The East/West portion of the marina basin will be approximately 80 feet wide by 725-feet long. The proposed marina basin will have two 60-foot wide access channels from the Foley Land Cut to the marina basin (one serving the North/South Basin and one serving the East/West Basin). From the Foley Land Cut to the North/South Basin, the access channel will be approximately 125 feet long. From the Foley Land Cut to the East/West marina basin, the access channel will be approximately 90 feet long. The cut will be approximately 1,050 feet wide at the confluence with the Foley Land Cut. The channel will be tapered to two 60-foot wide access channels at the marina entrance and the remaining interior portion (between the two 60-foot wide marina access channels) will be protected by the floating concrete wave attenuator. The northernmost portion of the North/South Basin will be excavated to a  depth of 9 feet below MLLW. The basin depth will increase to the south toward the access channel, where the proposed depth will be 10 feet MLLW.  The marina basin will include 76 wet slips to accommodate boats ranging from 30 to 130 feet long.  Sheet pile bulkheads/toe walls, one marine lift well, and 8 foot wide piers and mooring pilings will be located between each berthing slip. An 848-foot line ar floating concrete wave attenuator structure, supported by fixed concrete pilings will be installed between the two 60-foot wide basin entrances. All structures other than the riprap shoreline stabilization and the wave attenuator will be located within the marina basin.   Approximately 740 feet of shoreline will be stabilized by the placement of rip- rap protection along the marine access channel and the existing Foley Land Cut shoreline fronting the Permittee's property. Approximately 990 cubic yards of rip-rap will be placed below the plane of Mean High Water and 520 Cubic yards placed above this plane. An existing culvert under Waterway East Boulevard will continue to discharge into the northernmost portion of the proposed North/South marina  basin. The culvert's outfall will be newly designed to accommodate the construction of the proposed marina basin. The project will impact 0.01 acre of wetlands for excavation of t he marina, and 0.07 acre of wetlands to construct the entrance road at the northern edge of the property . To create and increase the length of the western shoreline, approximately 9,225 square feet of tidal open waters will be filled using 750 cubic yards of sand and 571 cubic yards of rock.    The Foley Land Cut (FLC) is a segment of the GIWW which is a federal commercial navigation channel.   Under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, the number of authorized wet and dry slips authorized along the FLC is carefully regulated  to ensure the navigational safety of commercial vessels operating within this waterway . An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was completed in 2009 that studied t he effects of new marina development on commercial navigati onal safety on t he FLC. The EIS conclu ded that, without identified mitigation measures being implemented , a maximum of 2,139 additional wet and dry boat slips could be authorized along the FLC. The EIS outlines how 1,818 additional boat slips would be initially available, and the remaining slips would be phased in after all initial slips were constructed and a 1 -year navigational safety evaluation completed. The Corps has currently authorized 1,716 additional wet and dry boat slips on the FLC. If authorized, the proposed project would   add an additional 78 wet and dry slips. The applicant has verified that no additional wet or dry slips are being proposed  for this project.",Baldwin County,,Gulf Shores,,['87.680160'],"['23.4', '30.281385']",,,0.01,wetland,,0.07,wetland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Latitude 30.3692° No rth, Longitude -88.594° West   PROPOSED","The applicant is requesting a 10- year Department of the Army Permit to construct a beneficial us e site for the placement of dredged material in the open waters of the Mississippi Sound. The purpose of this project as stated by the applicant is to create approximately 175 acres of marsh habitat  in an area referred to as Railroad Corner. The proposed project would be c onstructed within an180-acre  project site currently consisting of shallow, open water habitat with wate r depths which vary from -1 to -5.5 feet Mean lower low water (MLLW). The proposed si te is located within the Mississippi Sound east of the mouth of the West Pascagoula River with marsh systems located to the east and west, the CSX Railroad bridge located to the north running between Gautier and Pascagoula. During a survey completed in  September 2022, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) was located along the we stern portion of the project ar ea. SAV was present from the    edge of the marsh to approximat ely 15 feet waterward. Total acreage equals approximately 1.44 acres. No shellfish were observed withi n the project area during the survey.  The project components would include the construc tion of three berms to hold approximately  966,000 cubic yards of dredged material to suppor t the creation of appr oximately 175 acres of coastal marsh. An earthen berm would be c onstructed on the western side of the project area to preserve existing SAV habitat,  a v egetated berm would be constructed along the eastern portion of the proposed site, and a rock berm would be constructed along the southern extent of t he project area.     Rock Berm An approximately 1,365 linear foot rock berm with a crest elevation of +6.2 feet MLLW would be construct ed along the southern ex tent of the project area. A 60-foot gap would remain between the western marsh and the western end of the proposed rock berm to allow for continued flow to the ar ea containing SAV along t he western portion of the project site. Two 30-foot gaps would be pl aced within the rock be rm to allow for tidal exchange and fish passage. Approximately 926 s quare feet of brackish marsh would be covered at the eastern tie- in of the rock berm.    Vegetated Berm  An approximately 1,325 linear f oot vegetated berm with a maximum width of 55 feet and a crest elevation of +4.0 feet MLLW would be placed to reinforce a thin section of existing marsh on the eas tern side of the project area   Earthen Berm  An approximately 3,500 linear foot  earthen berm with a proposed crest elevation of +2 feet mean lower low water (M LLW) would be constructed to protect existing SAV habitat located along the western side of the project area. The earthen berm would tie into the western end of the rock berm and ex tend to the northern boundary, paralleling the shoreline and providing a minimum 25-foot open water buffer for the SAV. This would create a tidal creek which would provide ti dal flow and fish access to any naturally occurring tidal creeks within the created marsh located on the eastern side of the earthen berm. In addition to preserving the existing h abitat, the establishment  of the earthen berm could provide additional habitat for existing SAV along its western boundary.    Marsh habitat  elevations would vary between -0.5 feet to +3 feet MLLW =+0 .2 to +3.7 feet NAVD88) with a target elevation of +1.0-foot MLLW (+ 1.7 feet NAVD88). Marsh planting is not anticipated as a component of  the project. Due to the proximity of existing healthy marsh in the area, natural recruitment is ant icipated to provide seeding of the newly created BU areas. Juncus roemerianus (black needlerush) and Spartina alterniflora  (smooth cordgrass) are two common marsh species k nown to exist in adjacent marshes and would be likely volunteers for recruitment to t he newly constructed beneficial use cells.  Access channels  Due to the shallow depths in the vi cinity of the proposed berms, various construction access channels are proposed. A c onstruction access channel is proposed on the south side of the rock berm with an appr oach channel from t he mouth of Railroad Corner. Depending on site conditions, the construction channel may be located on the north side of the proposed rock berm. Access channels within the site along the western       earthen berm and to the eastern vegetated be rm may also be required for construction access. Access channels would be dredged to a bottom elevation of -6.7 foot, NAVD88 (-6.0 feet, MLLW) with a bottom width of 50 fee t. Dredged material from the channels would  be placed within the benef icial use site, for construction of the earthen berm, or for construction of the vegetated berm.

The project would provide sufficient clearance within the waterway to construct a berthing area without obstructing navigation.   PROPOSED","The applicant has proposed to mechanically excavate a 450-square- foot area of uplands and waterbottoms to create an incised boat slip within  West Fowl River.  Up to 70 cubic yards of material would be excavated from below the plane of mean high water (MHW). The proposed work would impact 225 square feet (0.005 acre) of tidal wetlands located on an intertidal shelf along the existing river bank. The excavated material would be placed within an adjacent 2,400- square- foot containment area located in uplands and surrounded by an     earthen berm and silt fencing. After dewatering, the material would be spread across the applicant’s upland lot.   Upon completion of the incised slip, the applicant would construct a 3- foot by 30-foot open- deck pier on the north side of the slip, within the incised area; the pier would extend 3 feet waterward of the newly created MHW line within the incised slip. The applicant would also construct a 45- linear -foot sheet -pile bulkhead bordering the east and south sides of the newly incised boat slip.

The purpose of this project as stated by the applicant is to restore and create sand dune and marsh habitat at the southeastern  tip of Cat Island that is similar to existing littoral habitats located on the southern and eastern shore of Cat Island, while also providing beneficia l use (BU) capacity for dredged material from future dredging projects. The site would be located within the Mississippi Sound at the southeast end of Cat Island and approximately 9 miles sout heast of Pass Christian, Mississippi. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE ) performed a beach and dune fill project on the eastern shore of Cat Island in 2017. The St ate-owned water bottoms were filled to an elevation above the mean high waterline which remain State-owned. The National Park Service (NPS) owns the land adjacent to state lands. The proposed 660-acre restoration project would not tie into NPS lands and would only tie into the previous USACE restoration project. The proposed 660-acre project site  would be created in two phases and dredged material for construction of all portions of  the project would be obtained from off-site locations.  Phase I   Approximately 250 acres would be construc ted to include approximately 91 acres of berm, 173 acres of dune, and 42 acres of mars h. Approximately 4.2 to 6.7 million cubic yards of borrow material would be required for construction of the proposed 12,700 linear foot sand berm and dunes. The interior c ontainment area would be able to hold approximately 575,000 to 750,000 cubic yards of  dredged material. Depths at the proposed site range from approximately 0 feet to -11.1 feet MLLW.   Phase 2   Approximately 410 acres would be c onstructed to include approximately 71 acres of berm, 149 acres of dune, and 168 acres of  marsh. Approximatel y 4.3 to 6.4 million cubic yards of borrow material would be r equired for construction of the proposed 12,300 linear foot sand berm and dunes. The interior containment area would be able to hold approximately 3.3 to 4.2 million cubic yards of dredged material. Depths at the proposed site range from approximately -1.6  feet to -11. 6 feet MLLW.   Sand Berms (25,000 linear feet) would have design cr est elevation of +8  feet mean lower low water (MLLW) (7.2 feet North Amer ican Vertical Datum of 1988 [NAVD88]). The proposed seaward berm slopes would be 30 horizontal feet to 1 vertical foot (30H1V) to match the geometry of the existing berms on Cat Island adjacent to the proposed project site.  The Phase 2 marsh side berm slope would be 10H1V. Sand for the proposed berms would be excavated from three potential USACE borrow sources located along the Port of Gulfport navigation channel. Material from t he borrow sources would be mechanically or hydraulically excavated and mechanically or hy draulically offloaded at the proposed project site. The estimated total volume  of material to be excavat ed would range from 8.5 to 13.1 million cubic yards. Within 3 year s of completion of initial construction, if natural breaches in the sand berms have not occurred, gaps would be created in the containment berm to allow for tidal flushing of the site and ingress and egress of aquatic organisms. The physical dimensions of the breaches/ gaps in the sand berms would be coordinated with regulatory agencies during final design.       Dune habitat would be created during the construc tion of the sand berms and would include all portions located above 1-foot MLLW (0.2 feet  NAVD88) which should be primarily emergent during normal tidal conditions.  Marsh habitat  elevations would vary between -0.5 feet to +3 feet MLLW (-1 .3 to +2.2 feet NAVD88). Marsh planting is not anticipated as a component of the project. Due to the proximity of existing healthy marsh on Cat Is land, natural recruitment is anticipated to provide seeding of the newly created BU areas. Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) and Spartina patens (salt meadow cordgrass)  are two common marsh species known to exist on Cat Island and would be likely volunteers for recruitment to the newly constructed BU cells.  Borrow Areas  Material to be dredged for construction of the Sand Berms and Dunes would be obtained from material previously dredged from the Gulfpor t Federal Navigation Channel which is routinely tested by USACE.   Borrow Area 1  Approximately 520 acres to be cut 7.5 feet deep for use of material estimated at 6.3 million cubic yards.

PROJECT PURPOSE The project purpose is to conserve and restore Robinson and Walker Islands for wildlife and public use by improving resilience of coastal habitats and the natural environment. PROPOSED","This project would consist of dredging and filling activities on and around Robinson Island and Walker Island. The applicant requests authorization to place material within subtidal and intertidal waters to enhance, restore, and create coastal marsh habitat within the Lower Perdido system using local sediment sources. An existing breakwater on the north side of Robinson Island would also be supplemented with additional rip rap material. Two borrow areas would be used to obtain approximately 308,000 cubic yards of material for construction in the event that beneficial use material is not available. Borrow area A (5 acres) would be dredged to an elevation of -11 feet NAVD88 and Borrow Area B (17 acres) would be dredged to an elevation of -15 feet NADV88. Around 95,000 total plants are proposed to be planted after creation of the new coastal habitat on the project islands. The three material placement areas are a) Walker Island West, b) Walker Island East, and c) Robinson Island. a. Approximately 73,350 cubic yards of sediment would be placed to create 4 acres of subtidal habitat, a 5-acre scrub-shrub platform, and a central 1-acre upland platform. The proposed configuration was designed to mimic the historic island footprint while avoiding  impacts to adjacent seagrass beds. The proposed elevation of the scrub-shrub platform is +4 feet NAVD88 with a typical width of 75 feet. In the center of the placement area would be a +6 feet NAVD88 elevation upland platform of variable width. The platforms and elevations were designed to maximize high elevation habitat to support bird habitat and overall longevity of the project. b. Approximately 120,240 cubic yards of sediment would be placed to create 1 acre of subtidal habitat, 1 acre of restored marsh habitat, 8 acres of scrub-shrub habitat, and 3 acres of upland habitat. The proposed configuration was designed to address erosion in the existing marsh, avoid seagrass impacts, and maximize elevations for bird habitat and longevity. Six inches of material would be used as thin-layer placement within the existing marsh to raise the platform elevation in response to erosion of sediment , loss of vegetation , and overall degradation of habitat. This would result in an elevation of approximately +1.5 feet NAVD88. The scrub-shrub platform has an elevation of +4 feet NAVD88 and a typical width of 75 ft. In the center of the placement area would be a +6 feet NAVD88 elevation upland platform of variable width. c. Approximately 44,455 cubic yards of sediment would be placed to create 1 acre of subtidal habitat, 3 acres of restored or created marsh habitat, and 3 acres of dune habitat. The proposed configuration was designed to address erosion in the existing marsh habitat, increase marsh and bird habitats on the island, and combat erosion. An existing breakwater would be supplemented with approximately 925 cubic yards of class 4 rip rap to achieve an elevation of +4.5 feet NAVD88. The new rock would tie into the existing submerged breakwater at an elevation of -1 .2 feet NAVD88 in order to maintain a continuous structure and eliminate the placement of new rock along most of the breakwater face through relocation of some existing rock.

PROPOSED","Following the removal of existing shoreline and waterward structures within the project area, the applicant proposes the re placement of exis ting bulkhead structures within the basin, construction of a new boat ramp with revetment,  docking facilities, and a kayak launch. The project would occur within  approximately  2.2-acres of estuarine waterbottoms and result in the permanent loss of 0.17- acre of emergent wetlands. Bulkhead reconstruction will include installation of steel sheet pile bulkhead with concrete cap along 1,430 linear feet of shoreline and replacement of a 106-linear -foot bulkhead by installing steel sheet pile 36- inches waterward of the existing  wall. Backfill will include an estimated 4,875 cubic yards  (CY) of clean fill material to be discharged below the plane of Mean High Water (MHW). The new four  (4) lane concrete boat ramp would require the discharge of 1,920 CY of concrete and revetment stone below MHW. A ±7,500- square-f oot (SF) shoreline revetment would be constructed along the southern edge of the basin and would include the discharge of 260 CY of clean fill and riprap material. Docking facilities  would provide one- hundred- one ( 101) open slips and would include the installation of ±22,213 SF of floating aluminum dockage, a ±274 SF floating fuel dock,  ±1,182 SF of floating a luminium boarding dockage, and ±1,460 SF of floating transient  and connecting dockage. Ancillary infrastructure includes eight (8) gangways and two (2) concrete access  platforms totaling ±216 SF.

PROJECT PURPOSE   The basic project purpose is to provide protection and restor ation of  an eroded shoreline .  The overall project purpose is to provide shoreline protection by restorin g the historic extent of the existing shoreline to the 1917 confi guration and restor e habitat function by reestablishing intertidal marsh and sand shoreline.   PROPOSED","The applicant proposes to restore, enhance, and protect 3.2 miles of shoreline adjacent to the Dauphin Island Parkway  and is anticipated to   reestablish up to 84 acres of tidal marsh. The shoreline protection and enhancement project will include the construction of 15,700 linear feet (LF) of low -profile rock breakwaters, the placement of 1,500,000 cubic yards  (CY) of beneficial use dredged material obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Mobile Harbor dredging project, and the planting of 410,000 native emergent tidal marsh vegetation. The project will also include d redging for the creation of 15,823 linear feet of temporary approach channels and of 33,000 LF of access channels , with  temporary side cast areas , within  89.8 acres  of estuarine waterbottoms . Material from access channels will be temporarily sidecast into 19.4 acre of waterbottoms within the footprint of the restoration area. The project would occur in two segments, a  North Segment and a S outh Segment . Each project segment will include a material staging area within the fill footprint for temporary stockpiling of sediment, which includes a 6- acre area for the North Segment and a 7-acre area for the South Segment.  Breakwater s will initially be installed along the southern third of both the North and South Segments, prior to sediment placement for the restored shoreline and marsh.  It is estima ted that the breakwater installation phase will take roughly 6 months for the North Segment and 9 months for the South Segment.  Breakwaters along the northern two thirds of the North and South Segments will be installed after shallow layer sand fill placement, after the introduced sediment consolidates. A portion of the breakwaters will be installed without segments or gaps. These continuous breakwaters are to later have gaps installed at least every 1,000- feet that are at least 25- feet wide within three years (Figures 2D and 2E). Rock excavated to form these gaps will be spread in the immediate area to serve as hard bottom oyster habitat. The gaps will provide larval and nekton access to the restored shoreline and marsh. Existing oyster beds within 500- feet of sediment placement will be protected with an enhanced bottom sealing turbidity curtain (Fishtech or approved equal).   Location specific project descriptions and dimensions   North Segment Construction Hydraulic dredging of 135,500 CY of subtidal, silty -sand waterbottoms for the creation of 18, 755 LF of temporary barge approach and access channels . The access channels will have an average width of 60 ft at the existing mudline and a depth of - 5.48 feet MLLW. For the North Segment, approximately 39,350 CY of stone will be used to build a continuous breakwater (Figure 2A), with a top elevation at +5.52 feet MLLW (Figures 2C and 2D). The North Segment breakwaters will be 40 feet wide at base, and collectively cover a bay bottom area of 7 acres. The breakwaters will be placed at varying distances  from the existing shoreline, up to a maximum of 625 feet into Mobile Bay.  Pile-mounted signage will mark the breakwater segments.  Following completion of the southern third of the breakwater c ontainment  structure s, approximately 500,000 cubic yards of beneficial use material , to be  delivered via barge, and will be hydraulically  pumped and/or mechanically placed into the 38- acre placement area. Elevation of the restored marsh at the north segment will range from +2.52 ft MLLW at the landward edge to +1.27 ft MLLW at the seaward edge (Figure 2H). After sufficient sediment compaction, tidal channels will be excavated (if not formed naturally) and native marsh vegetation (smooth cordgrass ( Spartina alterni flora), black needlerush ( Juncus roemerianus ), and salt meadow cordgrass ( Spartina patens )) will be planted on 3- foot centers.    South Segment Construction Excavation of 261,788 CY of subtidal, silty -sand waterbottoms for the creation of 30,068 LF of temporary barge approach and access channels. The access channels will have an average width of 60 ft at the existing mudline and a depth of - 5.48 feet MLLW. For the South Segment, approximately 63,130 CY of stone will be used to build a continuous breakwater (Figure 2B), with top elevation at +5.52 f eet MLLW, respectively (Figures 2C and 2E). The South Segment breakwater segments will be 50 f eet wide at base and cover a bay bottom area of 13 ac res. The South Segment will have typical linear breakwaters and semicircular breakwaters that will surround 0.5- acre oyster bay areas (Figure 2B). Typical oyster bay plans and sections are shown in Figure 2F. The breakwaters will be placed at varying distances from the existing shoreline, up to a maximum of 640 feet into Mobile Bay.

Upon completion of the required advertising and public comment review, a determination relative to WQ certification and CZ consistency will be made by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources.     This public notice is being distributed to all known interested persons in order to assist in developing facts on which a decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  (USACE)  can be based.  For accuracy and completeness of the record, all data in support of or in opposition to the proposed work should be submitted in writing setting forth sufficient detail to furnish a clear understanding of the reasons for support or opposition.   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The USACE  is soliciting comments from the public; Federal, State, and local agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the USACE to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.   Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.   Evaluation of the probable impacts involving deposits of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.   In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and Appendix C of 33 CFR 325, the undertaking defined in this notice is being considered for the potential to affect historic properties. In accordance with Appendix C of 33 CFR 325, the USACE  has determined the permit area consists of the entire project site.  The National Register of Historic Places has been consulted and no properties listed in or eligible for the National Register are known to exist which would be affected by the proposed work . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has made a preliminary determination that the proposed project would have no effect on  historic properties. However, we are seeking comment from   the State Historic Preservation Officer, federally recognized American Indian tribes, local historical societies, museums,  universities, the National Park Service, and the general public regarding the existence or the potential for existence of significant cultural and historic properties which may be affected by the work. This action constitutes the full extent of cultural resources investigations unless comment to this notice is received documenting that significant sites or properties exist which may be affected by this work, or that adequately documents that a potential exists for the location of significant sites or properties within the project area.   A preliminary review of this application, the U.S. Department of the Interior List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and the National Marine Fisheries Service list of Mississippi’s Threatened and Endangered S pecies  indicate the proposed activity  will have no effect on endangered or threatened species, or their critical habitat . This notice serves as request to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service for information on whether any listed or proposed to be listed endangered or threatened species may be present in the area which would be affected by the proposed activity.

The site would be approximately 900 acres (80 acres of containment berm and 820 acres to be used for the placement of dredged material for construction of marsh habitat). The northwestern portion of the proposed containment berm would be located approximately 1,870 feet southeast of the centerline of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The proposed containment berm would be approximately 28,000 linear feet and constructed of approximately 917,000 cubic yards of sediment dredged from the surrounding area immediately adjacent to the site and approximately 528,000 cubic yards of rip rap/armor stone material would be placed over the sediment berm once it has settled. The containment berm crest elevation would be approximately +5.0 mean low low water (MLLW), crest width 5 feet; exterior (waterside) slope 5 foot horizontal to 1 foot vertical (5H1V); interior slope 3H1V. Gaps in the containment berm would be included in the final design based on recommendations of the reviewing agencies. The planned gaps on the containment berm would allow for tidal flushing of the site and movement of water in and out of the site.

The overall project purpose is to protect an eroding shoreline, restore eroded tidal marsh, enhance existing tidal marsh, and re- establish historic depth and flow within Middle  Fork Deer River on the on the west shoreline of Mobile Bay.   PROPOSED","The applicant proposes  to stabilize 5,600 feet  of eroding shoreline to protect an existing 27 5-acre tidal marsh, restore  nineteen ( 19) acres of tidal marsh through beneficial use of dredged material, enhance approximately 51 acres of existing tidal marsh, and to improve water quality by restoring historic depth and flow within the waterbody . The project would utilize  50,000 cubic yards of sediment dredged by the applicant from Middle Fork Deer River and approximately 200,000 cubic yards of sediment dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from the Mobile Ship Channel Turning Basin, to provide fill material for restoration/enhancement of the tidal marsh system . The project involves  1) Installation of 375 linear feet (0. 5 acre) of pile- supported breakwater ; 2) C onstruct ion of  a temporary 2,950 linear feet (2acres) sand berm  containment dike to contain dredged material ; 3) Installation of 3,100   linear feet ( 2.9 acres) of segmented rock breakwater  constructed of Class IV rip- rap on marine mattress , featuring 130-foot gaps , and constructed at a height of +2.5- feet NAV88 ; 4) Dredging 44,000 cubic yards of sediment in 6 acres of open waters to create a temporary 3,830 linear foot construction access channel; 5)  Discharge 200,000 cubic yards of sediment dredged from the USACE Mobile Ship Channel Turning Basin into 19 acres of open waters to restore eroded tidal marsh; 6) Dredging 50,000 cubic yards  of sediment along 3,350 linear feet (9.0 acres) within Middle Fork Deer River; and 7) Thin- layer placement of 50,0 00 cubic yards of sediment from Middle Fork Deer River into 51 acres of existing tidal marsh at an overall  thickness of no greater  than 6 inches.  The thin- layer approach would increase the overall elevation of the existing marsh in order to enhance resilience to continued sea level rise and subsidence.
