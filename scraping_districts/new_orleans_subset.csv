The attached tables summarize the  impacts on wetlands and other waters of the U.S. associated with the proposed Terminal Facilities and Pipeline System, and as further described below.   CP2 LNG Terminal Facilities  The Terminal Facilities will be constructed on 785.5 acres.  Five existing storage yards (including four marine yards on Calcasieu Pass) close to the Terminal Facilities will support construction.  These yards comprise an additional 38.3 acres.    The Terminal Site will affect 631.7 acres and will include pretreatment, liquefaction, power generation, storage, and support facilities. The Marine Facilities will occupy 122.2 acres on the southwest shorel ine of Monkey Island, which is located between the Calcasieu Ship Channel and Calcasieu Pass.  The Marine Facilities will include two LNG carrier loading docks, an excavated/dredged berthing area, and land- based support facilities.  Three 1.0- mile-long, 42- inch outside diameter LNG transfer pipelines, a boil -off gas pipeline, and associated utilities will run underground within a 31.6- acre temporary construction corridor between the Terminal Site and Marine Facilities.   At the Terminal Site, approximately 327.9 acres of wetlands will be impacted, including 286.3 acres of palustrine emergent (PEM) wetland, 32.1 acres of palustrine scrub- shrub (PSS) wetland, 1.7 acres of palustrine forested (PFO) wetland, and 7.8 acres of estuarine intertidal emergent (E2EM) wetland (also categorized as essential fish habitat [EFH]).  Of the 327.9 impacted wetland acres, 314.8 acres will be permanently impacted, 0.7 acre will be subject to extended temporary impacts (lasting for the full dur ation of Project construction), and 12.4 acres will be subject to short -term temporary impacts.  Approximately 4.2 acres of open waters will be permanently impacted and 1.0 acre will be temporarily impacted.    At the Marine Facilities on Monkey Island, approximately 41.2 acres of wetlands will be permanently impacted, including 13.8 acres of PEM wetland, 12.6 acres of PSS wetland, 0.6 acre of PFO wetland, and 14.2 acres of E2EM wetland.  Of the 14.2 acres of E2EM wetland, 12.5 shoreline acres within the dr edge prism will be converted to open water and 1.7 acres will be permanently filled for onshore facility construction.  The E2EM wetland is categorized as EFH, along with 19.4 acres of tidal waters within the dredge prism, the 0.3 acre of land- based open w aters that will be permanently removed, and the 0.2 acre of land- based open waters that will be converted to deep water.   During construction, a temporary 6.8- mile-long pipeline will transport dredged material from the Marine Facilities to a marsh creation/restoration site located at Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge (CPNWR). The pipeline will temporarily impact approximately 15.0 acres of PEM wetlands and 0.1 acre of PSS wetlands.      3  Pipeline System   CP Express will construct approximately 85.4 m iles of 48- inch-diameter underground natural gas pipeline (CP Express Pipeline), 6.0 miles of 24- inch-diameter underground lateral pipeline (Enable Gulf Run Lateral), and associated aboveground facilities, all in Texas and Louisiana.  Facilities located wi thin the USACE -New Orleans District will be constructed on approximately 1,339.4 acres of land and include 58.5 miles of the CP Express Pipeline, most of the 6.0- mile-long Enable Gulf Run Lateral, one compressor station (Moss Lake Compressor Station), two standalone mainline valves, three standalone meter stations, and permanent access roads.  Construction of the Pipeline  System will be supported by four temporary storage yards, all in Calcasieu Parish, and temporary access roads.   The Pipeline System will impact approximately 741.8 acres of wetlands, including 388.8 acres of PEM wetland, 28.7 acres of PSS wetlands, 22.5 acres of PFO wetlands, 299.9 acres of E2EM wetlands, 0.4 acre of estuarine intertidal scrub-shrub ( E2SS) wetlands,  and 1.5 acres of palustrine aquatic bed (PAB) wetlands.  Approximately 33.0 acres of wetlands will be permanently lost (32.5 acres of PEM wetlands, 0.1 acre of PFO wetlands, and 0.4 acre of E2EM wetlands).  In addition, 22.4 acres of PFO wetlands will be converted to another wetland type.  Most wetlands on the Pipeline System will be only temporarily impacted, including 356.3 acres of PEM wetland, 28.7 acres of PSS wetland, 299.5 acres of E2EM wetland, 0.4 acre of E2SS wetland, and 1.5 acres of PAB wetland .  Horizontal directional drilling will avoid 16.9 acres of wetland impacts.   If a Department of the Army permit would be issued, the applicant has proposed a combination of purchasing mitigation bank credits from acceptable mitigation banks within the N. O. District, and a marsh creation/restoration project to mitigate unavoidable wetlands impacts.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed LNG terminal and pipeline.  The terminal facilities are located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  The proposed pipeline originates in Jasper County, Texas , and terminates at the terminal site in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  The FERC published a Final  EIS in J uly of 2023, under Docket numbers CP22- 21-000 and CP22- 22-000.

That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reas onably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  qualit y, energy  needs,  safety,  food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.    This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165- 2-220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that reasonably may  be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its 5  reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors   1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be             reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project      to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be            reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public             interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of            USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as            conservation, economic development, histori c properties, cultural resources,            environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual            risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This            evaluation will  consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes,            agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be            determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with r isks.  If the            potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be            determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.     The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact  to the usefulness of the            Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public            interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments fr om the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.   The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National  Register  of Historic  Places  at or near the proposed work  but is pending further review  in accordance with the National  Historic  Preservation Act. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.     6  FERC has entered into an informal consultation with the USFWS and the proposed plans are in review. This  notice also initiates a request for review and concurrence of our findings  for areas not covered under FERC jurisdiction. Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service,  it has been determined that the project is located in areas  known to be utilized  by the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus ), Eastern Black Rail ( Laterallus jamaicensis ssp. Jamaicensis ), Piping Plover ( Charadrius melodus ), Red Knot ( Calidris canutus rufa), and the Red-cockaded Woodpecker ( Picoides borealis ). CEMVN will coordinate the effect determination with USFWS for areas under Corps juris diction.              Our initial finding is that the proposed work may affect species listed as      endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and/or  habitat designated as   critical to the survival and recovery of any such species. FERC has entered into informal consultation with National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)  for areas in their ju risdiction . This notice also initiates  the Essential Fish Habitat  (EFH)  consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  for area s outside of FERC jurisdiction . The applicant's overall proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of  approximately 2,500 acres that can be considered essential fish habitat (EFH) for red drum, reef fish, coastal migratory pelagics, and shrimp, due to tidal hydrologic connectivity with mapped EFH areas (NMFS, 2021). Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse effect on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and would have a net beneficial effect . Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Ar my permit could be issued.   Any person  may request within the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing, and can be preferably  emailed to the USACE email address  listed above or mailed to the address listed above.

PROPOSED CP2 LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS  FACILITY AND CP EXPRESS PIPELINE IN  CALCASIEU AND CAMERON PARISHES   NAME OF APPLICANT : Venture Global CP2 LNG, LLC and Venture Global CP Express, LLC c/o: Environmental Resources Management, Attn: Alissa Ingham, 222 South 9th Street, Suite 2900, Minneapolis, MN 55402.   LOCATION OF WORK : The proposed facility and pipe line are located within the New Orleans and Galveston Districts, with the facility l ocated on the east bank of the Calcasieu Ship Channel , in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, and the proposed 85.4 miles  of pipeline  to be located in Texas and Louisiana . Approximately 58.1 miles of the CP Express pipeline will be located in Calcasieu and Cameron Parishes, as shown on the attached drawings  (located in the Calcasieu and Sabine Watersheds) .  CHARACTER OF WORK:  To construct and operate ( 1) natural gas liquefaction, storage, and export facilities at a Liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal (Terminal Facilities) near the mouth of the Calcasieu Ship Channel in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; and ( 2) associated pipeline facilities connecting the Term inal Facilities to the existing natural gas pipeline grid in east Texas and southwest Louisiana (Pipeline System).  The 2  Terminal Facilities consist of the mainland Terminal Site east of the ship channel and the Marine Facilities on Monkey Island.  LNG transfer and utility lines will run underground between the Terminal Site and the Marine Facilities.   The attached tables summarize the  impacts on wetlands and other waters of the U.S. associated with the proposed Terminal Facilities and Pipeline System, and as further described below.   CP2 LNG Terminal Facilities  The Terminal Facilities will be constructed on 785.5 acres.  Five existing storage yards (including four marine yards on Calcasieu Pass) close to the Terminal Facilities will support construction.  These yards comprise an additional 38.3 acres.    The Terminal Site will affect 631.7 acres and will include pretreatment, liquefaction, power generation, storage, and support facilities. The Marine Facilities will occupy 122.2 acres on the southwest shorel ine of Monkey Island, which is located between the Calcasieu Ship Channel and Calcasieu Pass.  The Marine Facilities will include two LNG carrier loading docks, an excavated/dredged berthing area, and land- based support facilities.  Three 1.0- mile-long, 42- inch outside diameter LNG transfer pipelines, a boil -off gas pipeline, and associated utilities will run underground within a 31.6- acre temporary construction corridor between the Terminal Site and Marine Facilities.   At the Terminal Site, approximately 327.9 acres of wetlands will be impacted, including 286.3 acres of palustrine emergent (PEM) wetland, 32.1 acres of palustrine scrub- shrub (PSS) wetland, 1.7 acres of palustrine forested (PFO) wetland, and 7.8 acres of estuarine intertidal emergent (E2EM) wetland (also categorized as essential fish habitat [EFH]).  Of the 327.9 impacted wetland acres, 314.8 acres will be permanently impacted, 0.7 acre will be subject to extended temporary impacts (lasting for the full dur ation of Project construction), and 12.4 acres will be subject to short -term temporary impacts.  Approximately 4.2 acres of open waters will be permanently impacted and 1.0 acre will be temporarily impacted.    At the Marine Facilities on Monkey Island, approximately 41.2 acres of wetlands will be permanently impacted, including 13.8 acres of PEM wetland, 12.6 acres of PSS wetland, 0.6 acre of PFO wetland, and 14.2 acres of E2EM wetland.  Of the 14.2 acres of E2EM wetland, 12.5 shoreline acres within the dr edge prism will be converted to open water and 1.7 acres will be permanently filled for onshore facility construction.  The E2EM wetland is categorized as EFH, along with 19.4 acres of tidal waters within the dredge prism, the 0.3 acre of land- based open w aters that will be permanently removed, and the 0.2 acre of land- based open waters that will be converted to deep water.   During construction, a temporary 6.8- mile-long pipeline will transport dredged material from the Marine Facilities to a marsh creation/restoration site located at Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge (CPNWR). The pipeline will temporarily impact approximately 15.0 acres of PEM wetlands and 0.1 acre of PSS wetlands.      3  Pipeline System   CP Express will construct approximately 85.4 m iles of 48- inch-diameter underground natural gas pipeline (CP Express Pipeline), 6.0 miles of 24- inch-diameter underground lateral pipeline (Enable Gulf Run Lateral), and associated aboveground facilities, all in Texas and Louisiana.  Facilities located wi thin the USACE -New Orleans District will be constructed on approximately 1,339.4 acres of land and include 58.5 miles of the CP Express Pipeline, most of the 6.0- mile-long Enable Gulf Run Lateral, one compressor station (Moss Lake Compressor Station), two standalone mainline valves, three standalone meter stations, and permanent access roads.  Construction of the Pipeline  System will be supported by four temporary storage yards, all in Calcasieu Parish, and temporary access roads.   The Pipeline System will impact approximately 741.8 acres of wetlands, including 388.8 acres of PEM wetland, 28.7 acres of PSS wetlands, 22.5 acres of PFO wetlands, 299.9 acres of E2EM wetlands, 0.4 acre of estuarine intertidal scrub-shrub ( E2SS) wetlands,  and 1.5 acres of palustrine aquatic bed (PAB) wetlands.  Approximately 33.0 acres of wetlands will be permanently lost (32.5 acres of PEM wetlands, 0.1 acre of PFO wetlands, and 0.4 acre of E2EM wetlands).  In addition, 22.4 acres of PFO wetlands will be converted to another wetland type.  Most wetlands on the Pipeline System will be only temporarily impacted, including 356.3 acres of PEM wetland, 28.7 acres of PSS wetland, 299.5 acres of E2EM wetland, 0.4 acre of E2SS wetland, and 1.5 acres of PAB wetland .  Horizontal directional drilling will avoid 16.9 acres of wetland impacts.   If a Department of the Army permit would be issued, the applicant has proposed a combination of purchasing mitigation bank credits from acceptable mitigation banks within the N. O. District, and a marsh creation/restoration project to mitigate unavoidable wetlands impacts.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed LNG terminal and pipeline.  The terminal facilities are located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  The proposed pipeline originates in Jasper County, Texas , and terminates at the terminal site in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  The FERC published a Final  EIS in J uly of 2023, under Docket numbers CP22- 21-000 and CP22- 22-000.  Information regarding the FERC review can be found on their website at: www.ferc.gov/news -events/news/final -eis-cp2-lng-and-cp-express -project -cp22- 21000- cp22- 22-000. The FERC has been identified as the lead federal agency and will be responsible for complying with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  for areas under their jurisdict ion.    The Corps h as acted as a cooperating agency on the preparation of the EIS with FERC.  The New Orleans Distr ict is evaluating the proposed facility and terminal site located in Cameron Parish, and the pipeline segment that extends to the terminal site to their District Boundary with the Galveston District Corps in Calcasieu Parish.     4  The Galveston District Cor ps is evaluating the proposed pipeline segment extending from Calcasieu Parish, at their District Boundary, into Newton and Jasper Counties, in Texas.

This public notice is also available for review online at : https://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/Public -Notices/   Corps of Engineers Permit  Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reas onably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  qualit y, energy  needs,  safety,  food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.    This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165- 2-220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that reasonably may  be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its 5  reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors:   1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be             reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project      to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be            reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public             interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of            USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as            conservation, economic development, histori c properties, cultural resources,            environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual            risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This            evaluation will  consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes,            agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be            determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with r isks.  If the            potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be            determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.     The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact  to the usefulness of the            Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public            interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments fr om the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.

This            evaluation will consider information received from  the interested parties, including tribes,            agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be            determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the            potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be            determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.     The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the            Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public            interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments rec eived will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine  whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.              The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National  Register  of Historic  Places  at or near the proposed work  but is pending further review  in accordance  with the National  Historic  Preservation Act. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural reso urces.   4     Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, it has been  determined that the project is located in wetlands and waters known to be utilized by the Eastern Black Rail ( Laterallus  jamaicensis ) and West Indian Manatee ( Trichechus manatus ) determined that the activity is not likely to adversely affect these species. If the DA permit is approved, the permittee will be required to the follow the mitigative conditions for the West Indian Manatee ( Trichechus manatus ).                       Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.       This notice initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH) consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 77.2 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid s hrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines  established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity  will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.  Any person may request within  the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.

Section  408).                          TEST WELLS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE STORAGE IN  VERMILION PARISH   NAME  OF APPLICANT : ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions Onshore Storage, LLC , c/o: Duplantis Design Group, 1308 Camellia Blvd., Suite 200, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508 .  LOCATION OF WORK : Test Well #1 @ Lat. 29- 46-57.31 N / Long. - 92-14-56.39 W; Test Well #2 @ Lat. 29 -47-44.82 N / Long. - 92-13-37.40 W; GIWW and North Prong of Schooner Bayou; Pecan Island Area; Abbeville, L ouisiana.   The proposed project is located in the 08080103 Vermilion River watershed.   CHARACTER OF WORK:  Proposed geological investigations via installation of 12,000 TVD ft. Class 5 stratigraphic test wells at two locations for potential storage of carbon dioxide. Test well site #1 requires excavation of an approximately 4,000'(L) x 128'(W) x 11'(D) canal and a 527'(L) x 364'(W) x 11'(D) slip. Test well site #2 requires expansion of an existing slip. Phased development is proposed such that test well #2 will be drilled first. If data obtained from test well #2 supports the need, test well #1 would then be constructed. If favorable conditions are determined at one or both wells, the existing wells will be converted to Class 6 injection wells. Approximately 283,739.6 cubic yards of native material will be excavated and used beneficially on site; approximately 45,142.4 cubic yards of native material will be excavated and placed on site to construct spoil banks and containment berms and approximately 74,190.6 cubic yards of native material 2  will be excavated and hauled off site.   Implementation of the proposed work will impact approximately 17.4 acres of marsh habitat, 28.2 acres of water bottoms, and 1.5 acres of upland habitat.  Approximately 38.4 acres of water bottoms will be filled as part of the Beneficial Use Dredged Material plan to create marsh habitat.  Should permit approval be considered acceptable, the applicant has proposed to mitigate any remaining unavoidable impacts through the use of a mitigation bank or banks in the project watershed, as deemed appropriate by the USACE and LDNR -OCM.

This public notice is also available for review online at https://go.usa.gov/xennJ   Corps  of Engineers  Permit  Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern  for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply and conservation,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.    This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165-2- 220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that 3  reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the followi ng factors:   1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be             reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project      to function as authorized, or would compromise or chang e any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be            reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public             interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of            USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as            conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources,            environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual            risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This            evaluation will consider information received from  the interested parties, including tribes,            agencies, and the public.

The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  Issuance of this public notice solicits input from the State Archeologist and State Historic Preservation Officer regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of such species.   The New Orleans District has determined that the  proposed project  activit ies will have no effect on any listed species , based on the Information & Planning Consultation for Endangered Species in Louisiana (IPaC), dated January 27, 2020 , between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services Office.        This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and  Management Act.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would have no adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is s ubject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria         The decision whether to issue a pe rmit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impac ts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern fo r both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit whic h reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its r easonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered incl uding the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aestheti cs, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values , flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, wa ter supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in  general, the needs and we lfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is so liciting comments from  the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tr ibes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this  proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determi ne whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this pr oposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, hi storic properties, water quality, general 3  environmental effects, and other public interest  factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the Nati onal Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to dete rmine the overall public interest of the proposed activity. Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative e ffects associated with the proposed project.    The New Orleans District utilizes the Nationa l Register of Historic Places to identify properties listed on or near the proposed work and is pres ently unaware of non-listed eligible properties nea r the project site.              The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, pr ehistorical, historical sites, or data. However, extent of impacts is undetermined at this time pending a National Historic Preservation Act compliance determination. As deemed necessary, copies of this notice are made available to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preserva tion Officer, and federally recognized Native American tribes regarding potent ial impacts to cultural resources.        Our initial finding is that the proposed work  would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Comme rce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and reco very of any endangered species.     Utilizing the Information & Planning Consul tation for Endangered Species in Louisiana protocol, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (CEMVN) and t he U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, CEMVN has determined that the proposed project is located in an area which may be utilized by the red-cockaded woodpecker ( Picoides borealis ) and a No Affect Determination has been made.   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Ha bitat (EFH) consultati on requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and M anagement Act.  The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adv erse impact on EFH or federa lly managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dre dged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable im pacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Prot ection Agency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable wa ter quality standards wil l be required from the Department of Environmental  Quality, Office of Envi ronmental Services, before a permit is issued.    Any person may request, (prefe rably by email to the project manager, or in writing), within the comment period specifi ed in this notice, that a public  hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings s hall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public  hearing.  4         You are invited to communicate the information contai ned in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering  Circular  (EC) 1165-2- 220, which  provides  policy  and procedural  guidance  for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.  The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several  factors. The benefits  that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors  3   1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations  will be reviewed to determine whether  the alteration would  limit the ability  of the USACE  project to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts,  on the  public interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources, environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This evaluation  will consider  information  received  from the interested  parties,  including  tribes, agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be determined by the consideration of whether  benefits  are commensurate with risks. If the potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.   The Section 408 review  will consider  the potential  impact  to the usefulness  of the Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental  Assessment and/or  an Environmental  Impact  Statement  pursuant  to the National  Environmental  Policy  Act.

Any request for an extension of time to comment must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Branch Chief will review the request and the requester will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request.  If granted, the time extension will be continuous and inclusive of the initial comment period and will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. This public notice is also available for review online at https://go.usa.gov/xennJ   Corps  of Engineers  Permit  Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national  concern for  both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, flo odplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs  and welfare of the people.   This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering  Circular  (EC) 1165-2- 220, which  provides  policy  and procedural  guidance  for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.  The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several  factors. The benefits  that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors:  3   1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations  will be reviewed to determine whether  the alteration would  limit the ability  of the USACE  project to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts,  on the  public interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources, environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This evaluation  will consider  information  received  from the interested  parties,  including  tribes, agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be determined by the consideration of whether  benefits  are commensurate with risks. If the potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.   The Section 408 review  will consider  the potential  impact  to the usefulness  of the Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental  Assessment and/or  an Environmental  Impact  Statement  pursuant  to the National  Environmental  Policy  Act. Comments  are also used  to determine  the need  for a public hearing and to determine the overall  public interest of the proposed activity.   The New Orleans  District  has previously  coordinated this projects’  106 interests with the LA State Historic Preservation Office and interested Tribal Liasons during the processing of the previous authorization.  No new work and no new work areas are proposed in this time extension request.  Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species. Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana,  as signed on January  27, 2020,  between the  U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers,  New Orlea ns and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, it has been determined that the project would have no effect to any listed species.  4   Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery  of any such  species. All Section 7 T&E Species concerns and coordination were previously addressed through the previous authorization.  No new work is proposed.   This notice  initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH) consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 256.7 acres  of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination  with the National  Marine  Fisheries  Service. This project  was designed to offset all project related impacts to wetlands through the creation of approximately 100 acres of new marsh.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,  the evaluation of the probable impacts  will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity  will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality  before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.  Any p erson  may request  within  the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing, and can be preferably  emailed to the USACE project manager listed above or mailed to the address listed above.

Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.   3   The New Orleans District utilizes the Nationa l Register of Historic Places to identify properties listed on or near the proposed work and is pres ently unaware of non-listed eligible properties nea r the project site.      The possibility exists that the propos ed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, pr ehistorical, historical sites, or data. However, extent of impacts is undetermined at this time pendi ng a National Historic Preservation Act compliance determination. As deemed necessary, copies of this notice are made available to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally recognized Native American tribes regarding potent ial impacts to cultural resources.        Our initial finding is that the proposed work  would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Comme rce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.      Utilizing the Information & Planning Consul tation for Endangered Species in Louisiana protocol, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (CEMVN) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, CEMVN has determined that the proposed project is located in wate rs known to be utilized by the Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus ); however, the proposed work has been determined not likely to adversely affect this species as there will be no dredging activities associated with the work and no water intake structures.   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Ha bitat (EFH) consultati on requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and M anagement Act.  The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adv erse impact on EFH or federa lly managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dre dged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable im pacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards wil l be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Envi ronmental Services, before a permit is issued.    Any person may request, (prefe rably by email to the project manager, or in writing), within the comment period specifi ed in this notice, that a public  hearing be held to consider this application.

The benefits that reasonably may be expected to accrue from t he proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review t eam considering the following factors  1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be             re viewed to determine whether the alteration would lim it the ability of the U SACE project      to function as authorized, or would co mpromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.

If the            potential detri ments are found to outweigh the potent ial benefits, then it may be            determined that  the proposed alteration is inju rious to the public interest.     The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the            Federal projec t and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public            interes t.

FLOOD PROTECTION LEVEE CONSTRUCTION IN TERREBONNE PARISH  NAME OF APPLICANT: Terrebonne Levee & Conservation District, c/o: GIS Engineering, LLC, 2503 Petroleum Drive, Suite 110, Houma, Louisiana 70363.  LOCATION OF WORK: Located in Terrebonne Parish, along La. Highway 182, Bayou Black and Geraldine Road, near the communiti es of Houma and Gibson, Louisiana, (lat. 29.590575, long. -90.8309972), as shown within t he enclosed drawings. (Hydrologic Unit Code 8090301, Barataria Watershed).  The work described below was partially comple ted prior to obtaining a Department of the Army permit and was in violation of Section 301 of the Clean Water Act.  All legal issues concerning the unauthorized work  have since been deferred.    CHARACTER OF WORK: This proposal is for Department  of The Army authorization to construct four flood protection levees re ferred to as the Bayou Black Barrier Levee project (BBBL), Reaches 1, 2, 3, and 4, all as part of the Morganza to Gulf Flood Protection System. The project was originally placed on 20-day public notice (PN) on October 11, 2021.  Due to updates on the overall BBBL proposal, combination of multiple levees and applications into a single application, and the length of time since the original posting, a secondary PN is being issued.  The project stretches from LA 182 in Gibson heading southeasterly towards the Minors Canal outfall ending at the 2  Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW).  T he project includes construction of an approximate 19 mile long levee system with a proposed barge gate and gate section along the GIWW, and is intended to help prevent flooding of human habitable areas, commercial properties, agricultural areas, and to maintain and regulate drainage channels within the protected area.  F ill operations includes the deposition of approximately 772,698 cy of ma terial, and excavation of approximately 7,940 cy of on-site material.  The levees will be construct ed to Elevation of +7.0 and will have a 3H:1V side slope.  The project includes a total of 60. 68 acres of direct impacts to jurisdictional Bottomland Hardwoods wetlands and 47.63 acres of direct impacts to jurisdictional Cypress Tupelo wetlands.  All 4 levee reac hes are described further  in detail in the enclosed drawings.   If a Department of t he Army permit is found to be in the public interest, the applicant has proposed to miti gate unavoidable wetlands impacts at an approved and acceptable mitigation bank or banks within the N.O. District.  The applicant may be required to fully or par tially restore the site to pre-project conditions if issuance of a permit is determi ned to be contrary to the public interest.  The comment period on the requested Depart ment of the Army Permit will close 20 days from the date of this public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the propos ed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this  permit request, and must be submitted so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period.  Letters and/or comments concerning the subject permit app lication must reference the Applicant's Name and the Permit Application Number and can be preferably emailed to the Corps of Engineer’s project manager listed above or forwarded to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY DIVISION, RGW, Johnny Duplantis.  Individuals or parties may also reques t an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by mail or pr eferably by emailing the specified project manager listed above.  Any request for an ex tension of time to  comment must be specific and substantively supportive of t he requested extension and received by this office prior to the end of t he initial comment period.  T he Branch Chief will review the request and the requester will be prom ptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request.

This public notice is also available for review online at https://go.usa.gov/xennJ   Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impact s of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important res ources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be rele vant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environment al concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and 3  wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values , land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of  the people.   This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165-2-220, which pr ovides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter U SACE civil works projects.  The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be bas ed on several factors.   The benefits that reasonably may be expected to accrue from t he proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review t eam considering the following factors:  1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be             re viewed to determine whether the alteration would lim it the ability of the U SACE project      to function as authorized, or would co mpromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USAC E determines that t he usefulness of the authorized project would be impai red, the request will be denied.   2) Potential to be Injurious to the Pub lic Interest.  Proposed alterations will be            reviewed to dete rmine the probable impacts, including cumula tive impacts, on the public             interest.  Fact ors that may be relevant to the publ ic interest depend upon the type of            USACE project bei ng altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as            conservation, economic development, historic pr operties, cultural resources,            environmental im pacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual            risk, induced dam ages, navigation, shore erosion or a ccretion, and recreation.  This            evaluation will cons ider information received from the in terested parties, including tribes,            agencies, and the public.  The dec ision whether to approve an alteration will be            determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the            potential detri ments are found to outweigh the potent ial benefits, then it may be            determined that  the proposed alteration is inju rious to the public interest.     The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the            Federal projec t and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public            interes t.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is  soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by t he U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, m odify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are us ed to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects,  and other public interest factors listed above. Comment s are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Envir onmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments ar e also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity. 4   The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National Register of Historic  Places at or near the propos ed work but is pending further review in accordance with the National Histor ic Preservation Act. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or  data. As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potent ial impacts to cultural resources.  Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27,  2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Servic e, it has been determined that the project is located in habitat k nown to be utilized by the Western Manatee (Trichechus manatus ) and the Eastern Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis ssp. jamaicensis), and determined that the activity is not likely to adversely affect these species. If the DA permit is approved, t he permittee will be required to the follow the IPaC mitigative conditions for the West ern Manatee (Trichechus manatus) and the Eastern Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis ssp. jamaicensis).                         Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species             listed as endan gered by the U.S. Depar tment of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as  critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.     This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservati on and Management Act. The applicant's proposal may result in the destructi on, alteration, and/or disturbance of 47.63 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action wo uld not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Ou r final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures  is subject to review by and coordination with the Nationa l Marine Fisheries Service.  If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of t he probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate appli cable water quality standards will be required from the Loui siana Department of Enviro nmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.

The New Orleans District has determined that the work is located in waters known to be utilized by the Pallid Sturgeon ( Scaphirhynchus albus ) and the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus ) and furthermore concluding the activity is not likely to adversely affect this species based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on  January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. If the project is authorized, cutterhead/suction dredge operational parameters and steps to avoid detrimental effects to the threatened West Indian Manatee will be included as permit conditions.     -4-  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of  the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's  proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of N/A acres of  EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial  determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact  on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determinati on relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by  and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable  waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines  established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards  will be required from the LA Department of Environmental Quality before a Department  of the Army permit is issued.   Any person may request, (preferably by email to the project manager, or in writing), within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.   The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with  and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program (Louisiana Coastal Zone Application P20220645). The Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval  or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  Issuance of this public notice solicits input from the State Archeologist and State Historic Preservation Officer regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   It has been determined that the proposed activi ties have No Effect  on the Gopher Tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)  or the Red- cockaded Woodpecker (Piciodes borealis)  and are Not Likely to Adversely Affect the Louisiana Quillwort (Isoetes louisianensis)  based on the Information & Planning Consultation for Endangered Species in Louisiana (IPaC), dated January 27, 2020 between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services Office.    Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to  the survival and recovery of such species.   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal is not expected to result in the destruction, alteration , and/or disturbance of 0.0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would have no adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our f inal determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality stan dards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications, before a permit is issued.   Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.

Any request for an extension of time to comment must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Branch Chief will review the request and the requester will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request.  If granted, the time extension will be continuous and inclusive of the initial comment period and will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. This public notice is also available for review online at https://go.usa.gov/xennJ   Corps of Engineers Permit  Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety,  food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.            3  The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National  Register  of Historic  Places  at or near the proposed work  but is pending further review  in accordance with the National  Historic  Preservation Act. The possibility exists that th e proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species. Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Specie s in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service,  it has been determined that the project would have no effect to any listed species.                      Our initia l finding is that the proposed work would have no effect  on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.     This notice initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH)  consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.  Any person  may request within the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing, and can be preferably  emailed to the USACE project m anager listed above or mailed to the address listed above.         4  You are invited  to communicate the information contained in this notice  to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

This public notice is also available for review online at https//go.usa.gov/xennJ   Corps  of Engineers  Permit  Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern  for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of  property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine  whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.               3  The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National  Register  of Historic  Places  at or near the proposed work  but is pending further review  in accordance  with the National  Historic  Preservation Act. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tri bes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, it has been  determined that the project is located in an area known to be utilized by the Northern Long Eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis ) and determined that the activity is not likely to adversely affect this species.  If the DA permit is approved, the permittee will be required to the follow the IPaC mitigative conditions for the above mentioned species .                 Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.

Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine  whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.               3  The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National  Register  of Historic  Places  at or near the proposed work  but is pending further review  in accordance  with the National  Historic  Preservation Act. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tri bes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, it has been  determined that the project is located in an area known to be utilized by the Northern Long Eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis ) and determined that the activity is not likely to adversely affect this species.  If the DA permit is approved, the permittee will be required to the follow the IPaC mitigative conditions for the above mentioned species .                 Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.     This notice initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH) consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review  by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.  If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity  will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.              4     Any person may request within  the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing, and can be preferably  emailed to the USACE project manager listed above or mailed to the address listed above.   You are invited  to communicate the inform ation contained  in this notice  to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.             Enclosures   Darrell  S.

The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.    Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species. Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service,  it has been determined that the project would have no effect to any listed species.                   Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.     This notice initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH)  consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 5.24 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.  If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.   Any person  may request within the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing, and can be preferably  emailed to the USACE project manager listed above or mailed to the address listed above.         -4-  You are invited  to communicate the information contained in this notice  to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

If granted, the time extension will be continuous and inclusive of the initial comment period and will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. This public notice is also available for review online at https//go.usa.gov/xennJ   Corps of Engineers Permit  Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important  resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety,  food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   4    This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165- 2-220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors   1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be             reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project      to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be            reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public             interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of            USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as            conservation, economic development, historic properti es, cultural resources,            environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual            risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This            evaluation will consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes,            agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be            determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the            potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be            determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.     The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the us efulness of the            Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public            interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine  whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.       5  The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National  Register  of Historic  Places  at or near the proposed work  but is pending further review  in accordance with the National  Historic  Preservation Act. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources .   Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service,  it has been determined that the project is located in wetlands and/or waters known to be utilized by the Eastern Black Rail ( Laterallus jamaicensis spp. jamaicensis ), the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus ), the Red- cockaded Woodpecker ( Picoides borealis ), the Piping Plover ( Charadrius melodus ), the Red Knot ( Calidris canutus rufa), the Hawksbill Sea Turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata), Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle ( Lepidochelys kempii ), the Leatherback Sea Turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea), and the Loggerhead Sea Turtle ( Caretta caretta ) and on April 24, 2023, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviewed the project for effects to Federal trust resources under their jurisdiction and currently protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act.) The project is not likely to adversely affect those resources. No impacts to sea turtle nesting habitat. If the DA permit is approved, the permittee will be required to the follow the IPaC mitigative conditions for the West Indian Manatee ( Trichechus manatus ).                   Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.     This notice initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH)  consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 260.6 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   On March 24, 2023, NMFS issued the Final Essential Fish Habitat Assessment dated March 2023 to FEMA, which stated that most anticipated impacts to Essential  Fish Habitat will be temporary and that NMFS does not object to the project as proposed.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.   6  Any person  may request within the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.

All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety,  food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   4    This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165- 2-220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors:   1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be             reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project      to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be            reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public             interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of            USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as            conservation, economic development, historic properti es, cultural resources,            environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual            risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This            evaluation will consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes,            agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be            determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the            potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be            determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.     The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the us efulness of the            Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public            interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine  whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.       5  The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National  Register  of Historic  Places  at or near the proposed work  but is pending further review  in accordance with the National  Historic  Preservation Act. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources .   Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service,  it has been determined that the project is located in wetlands and/or waters known to be utilized by the Eastern Black Rail ( Laterallus jamaicensis spp. jamaicensis ), the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus ), the Red- cockaded Woodpecker ( Picoides borealis ), the Piping Plover ( Charadrius melodus ), the Red Knot ( Calidris canutus rufa), the Hawksbill Sea Turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata), Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle ( Lepidochelys kempii ), the Leatherback Sea Turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea), and the Loggerhead Sea Turtle ( Caretta caretta ) and on April 24, 2023, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviewed the project for effects to Federal trust resources under their jurisdiction and currently protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act.) The project is not likely to adversely affect those resources. No impacts to sea turtle nesting habitat. If the DA permit is approved, the permittee will be required to the follow the IPaC mitigative conditions for the West Indian Manatee ( Trichechus manatus ).                   Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.     This notice initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH)  consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 260.6 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   On March 24, 2023, NMFS issued the Final Essential Fish Habitat Assessment dated March 2023 to FEMA, which stated that most anticipated impacts to Essential  Fish Habitat will be temporary and that NMFS does not object to the project as proposed.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.   6  Any person  may request within the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing, and can be preferably  emailed to the USACE project manager listed above or mailed to the address listed above.   The applicant  has certified  that the proposed activity  described in the application complies with and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Department of Natural Resource’s Coastal Resources Program (Application # P20220805 ). The Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of t he proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public  interest of the proposed activity. Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.    The New Orleans District utilizes the National Register of Historic Places to identify properties listed on or near the proposed work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. However, extent of impacts is undetermined at this time pending a National Historic Preservation Act compliance determination. As deemed necessary, copies of this notice are made available to the State Archeologist and the Stat e Historic Preservation Officer, 3  and federally recognized Native American tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.        Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species under their jurisdiction.    Utilizing the Information & Planning Consultation for Endangered Species in Louisiana protocol, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (CEMVN) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, CEMVN has determined that the proposed project is located in waters known to be utilized by the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus ) and with the inclusion of the Standard Manatee Conditions for In-Water Activities, the proposed work is not likely to adversely affect the West Indian Manatee. Additionally, the proposed work has been determined not likely to adversely affect Pallid Sturgeon ( Scaphirhynchus albus ) as the cutterhead/suction dredge operational parameters will also be included as permit conditions.   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 12  acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include t he application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection A gency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water qualit y standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environm ental Services, before a permit is issued.    Any person may request, (preferably by email to the project manager, or in writing), within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.   The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program (Louisiana Coastal Zone Application P20220137).

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of t he proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public  interest of the proposed activity. Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.    The New Orleans District utilizes the National Register of Historic Places to identify properties listed on or near the proposed work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. However, extent of impacts is undetermined at this time pending a National Historic Preservation Act compliance determination. As deemed necessary, copies of this notice are made available to the State Archeologist and the Stat e Historic Preservation Officer, 3  and federally recognized Native American tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.        Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species under their jurisdiction.    Utilizing the Information & Planning Consultation for Endangered Species in Louisiana protocol, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (CEMVN) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, CEMVN has determined that the proposed project is located in waters known to be utilized by the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus ) and with the inclusion of the Standard Manatee Conditions for In-Water Activities, the proposed work is not likely to adversely affect the West Indian Manatee. Additionally, the proposed work has been determined not likely to adversely affect Pallid Sturgeon ( Scaphirhynchus albus ) as the cutterhead/suction dredge operational parameters will also be included as permit conditions.   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 12  acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include t he application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection A gency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water qualit y standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environm ental Services, before a permit is issued.    Any person may request, (preferably by email to the project manager, or in writing), within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.   The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program (Louisiana Coastal Zone Application P20220137).  The Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.           You are invited to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.     John M.

Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no e ffect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.    Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it has been determined that the project would have no effect to any species  listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species .   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.    If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the pro bable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from th e LA Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit is issued.

This public notice is also available for review online at https://go.usa.gov/xennJ .   Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria         The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public  interest of the proposed activity. Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.   3  The New Orleans District utilizes the National Register of Historic Places to identify properties listed on or near the proposed work.  The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. However,  extent of coverage and impacts is undetermine d at this time pending a National Historic Preservation Act compliance determination. Copies  of this notice are made available to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.     Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species under their jurisdiction.

This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of NA  acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include t he application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection A gency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water qualit y standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environm ental Services, before a permit is issued.

The methods are rapid  assessment tool s to help distinguish between ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial streamflow at the reach scale for the Northeast and Southeast SDAM Regions. The beta SDAM s may help provide technical guidance for identifying waters that may be subject to regulatory jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act ; however , these methods do not alter or change the definition of “ Waters of the U.S. ”   These beta SDAM s were developed for use in all or part of the s tates of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri , Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas , and the District of Columbia  by the Corps and  EPA (Figure 1). Due to differences in climate and a relatively small amount of data points, the Caribbean sites were not used to develop this iteration of the SDAM , nor is the Caribbean covered by the methods. Th ese beta methods result from a literature review and multi-year field study conducted at 336 stream reaches across the range of hydrologic landscapes of the Northeast and Southeast. Developed through statistical analyses  of the field data, the beta SDAMs  provide a data -driven approach using reliable indicators to determine  streamflow duration class at the reach scale. The agencies are making these beta SDAM s available for a one year preli minary implementation and comment period to inform the development of final SDAM s for the Northeast and Southeast .    The beta SDAM s for the Northeast and Southeast can be applied  whenever there is uncertainty regarding streamflow duration class  and a rapid evaluation method is desired . The methods provide a scientifically supported, rapid assessment framework to support best professional judgment in a consistent, robust, repeatable, and defensible way. Use of the methods may  result in timelier and more predictable jurisdictional determinations and are also useful where knowledge of streamflow duration class improves ecological assessment, management, and decision-making. The beta S DAM s were developed specifically from data collected in the Northeast and Southeast.   The methods, data forms , and training opportunities are available on the internet at:  https://www.epa.gov/streamflow-duration- as sessment/beta- streamflow -duration- assessment -method -northeast- and-southeast .   Practitioners such as stream ecologists, aquatic ecologists, hydrologists, and wetland scientists are encouraged to comment on their experience using the beta SDAM s. Comments regarding the following specific topics would be especially useful:   • Problem situations encountered and possible approaches for addressing them. • Seemingly  incorrect r esults, including the factors that suggest the method was in accurate. • Indicators that were particularly useful or not useful in identifying flow duration in different hydrological environments. • Regional differences in the applicability of specific indicato rs. • Potential uses of the methods in the regulatory context, or in other watershed planning or management contexts.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria   The decision whether to issue a Section 10/404 permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced  against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those  are conservation, economics,  aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the p ublic, federal, state, and local  agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determ ine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the  proposed activity.  Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.   The New Orleans District i s unaware of any properties  listed on the National Register of Historic Places near the proposed work.  The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or  destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   3  Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any s pecies listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.  Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) , it has been determined that the proposed project may affect the Eastern Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis ssp.  jamaicensis) , and is not likely to adversely affect  the Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) or the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus).   Consultation with USFWS regarding potential project -related effects to the Eastern Black Rail is in progress.  Standard Manatee Conditions for In- Water Activities will be added to the permit, if authorized.   This notice initiates the Essential Fi sh Habitat  (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction or alteration of approximately 732-acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaei d shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a c ertification that the proposed activity  will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of  Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications , before a permit is issued.   Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.

This public notice is also available for review online at https//go.usa.gov/xennJ .    Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria   The decision whether to issue a Section 10/404 permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced  against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those  are conservation, economics,  aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the p ublic, federal, state, and local  agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determ ine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the  proposed activity.  Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.   The New Orleans District i s unaware of any properties  listed on the National Register of Historic Places near the proposed work.  The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or  destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   3  Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any s pecies listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.  Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) , it has been determined that the proposed project may affect the Eastern Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis ssp.  jamaicensis) , and is not likely to adversely affect  the Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) or the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus).   Consultation with USFWS regarding potential project -related effects to the Eastern Black Rail is in progress.  Standard Manatee Conditions for In- Water Activities will be added to the permit, if authorized.   This notice initiates the Essential Fi sh Habitat  (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction or alteration of approximately 732-acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaei d shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a c ertification that the proposed activity  will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of  Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications , before a permit is issued.   Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.

This public notice is also available for review online at https://go.usa.gov/xennJ   Corps  of Engineers  Permit  Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern  for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, flo odplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine  whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.               3  The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.   As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.    Our initial finding is that the propose d work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species. Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, it has been  determined that the project would have no effect to any listed species.                      Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect  on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.                This notice initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH) consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The ap plicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Ser vice.  If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity  will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.  Any person may request within  the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing, and can be preferably  emailed to the USACE project manager listed above or mailed to the address listed above.    4   You are invited  to communicate the information contained  in this notice  to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165 -2-220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for  modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors   1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.           2)   Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of  USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources, environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This evaluation will consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes, agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.           T he U .S.

Specific legislation requiring Department of the Army permits for work of this nature: a. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344).The work and activities specifically intended for authorization under this generalpermit are the construction of individual single-family homesites, residential subdivisions and multiple-unit residential complexes; associated drainage, roadway, sanitary, and utility infrastructure, and; typical amenities such as storage sheds, swimming pools, garages, driveways, and landscaping.   Under this general permit, when the construction of an individual single-family residence is being proposed for personal use/occupation by the applicant, the activity may not exceed an aggregate loss of 0.50 acre of jurisdictional wetlands. When the construction of multiple single-family residences (i.e., a subdivision) or a multiple-unit residential complex is being proposed for commercial sale to potential occupants, the activity may not exceed an aggregate loss of 3.0 acres of jurisdictional wetlands.  Whenever any other nationwide or general permit is used in conjunction with thisgeneral permit, the total acreage of jurisdictional wetland loss combined cannot exceed - 2 - the appropriate threshold.  In addition, any activity performed in conjunction with the proposed development that degrades existing jurisdictional project site wetlands without actually incurring a loss of waters of the U.S., such as the removal of native vegetation for aesthetic purposes, will be counted towards thresholds established for this general permit.  Last, a determination will be made as to scope of the proposed activity’s impact on jurisdiction of any adjacent wetlands on a case-by-case basis     Prior to written approval from the New Orleans District (MVN), each request for work covered by this general permit will be reviewed to determine impacts to the natural and human environment to determine if approval is not contrary to the public interest. A detailed justification of project need and project alternatives considered, including other potential project locations and project designs, supporting the applicant’s view that the proposed activity represents the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative must be submitted with the application (see Section 3).  This general permit will authorize work in those areas which are located within the boundaries of the U.S. Army Engineer District, New Orleans, but outside the Louisiana Coastal Zone (LCZ), UNLESS the activity is within the LCZ but specifically or partially exempt from coastal use permitting as determined by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management (OCM).  The map attached to this permit shows the approximate boundaries of the District (attachment 1).  1. Inclusions:  The following are examples of work that may be eligible under this permit:a. Single-family residences proposed for individual personal use. b. Residential subdivisions and multiple-unit residential complexes.c. New homesites and appurtenances in an established residential subdivision.  An established subdivision is defined as an area having a hard surface or aggregate road system, parish-approved drainage infrastructure and utilities, and an approved central sewerage system.  The homesite and/or appurtenances must be the primary residence or in direct association with the primary residence of the permittee or a member of his/her immediate family. d.   Any residential subdivision proposing impacts to jurisdictional wetlands that comport to the threshold, described herein. 2. Exclusions:  The following work will not be eligible under this general permit.  Applications for this work will be processed in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325.a. Piecemeal development; the proposed activity must be a single and complete project.  In addition, the use of this general permit will not be applicable to a “phased” development of a larger project.   - 3 -Work subject to authorization under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Actof 3 March 1899 (33 USC 403).With the exception to activities required for compliance with GP-3  specialconditions f. and g. on page 6, work within the banks of natural drains.  For thepurposes of this General Permit, natural drains are defined as any stream,slough, bayou, creek, etc. that has been formed by natural geomorphicprocesses, including those systems which may have been altered byanthropogenic forces. Additionally, a 50 foot avoidance buffer zone shall beextended to all riparian wetlands and floodways, where applicable.Work within jurisdictional wetland areas that are prone to prolonged inundation(e.g., seasonally flooded bottomland hardwoods and cypress-tupelo swamp).This general permit will not authorize work within the following areas:Work authorized under General Permit-31 may not be performed in areaswhere the activity is likely to result in a ""disturbance"" to bald eagles.  If abald eagle nest occurs within 660 feet of the proposed project area, thenan evaluation must be performed to determine whether the project islikely to disturb nesting bald eagles.  That evaluation can be conductedon-line at:http://www.fws.gov/southeast/birds/Eagle/tamain.htmlApplicants are advised to review the National Bald Eagle Management(NBEM) Guidelines for information and recommendations to minimizepotential project impacts to bald eagles.

The New Orleans Distric t is unaware of properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places near the proposed work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy pr esently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  Issuance of this public notice solicits input fr om the State Archeologist and State Historic Preservation Offic er regarding potential impacts to cultural resources. 3 The New O rleans D istrict has determined that t he proposed pr oject  activities ar e not likely to adversely affect the threatened E astern Black R ail, endangered Pallid Sturgeon or the threatened West I ndian Manatee wit h the inclusion of I ntake Conditions an d the Standard Manatee Conditions, b ased on the I nformatio n & Planning Consultation for Endanger ed Species i n Louisiana ( IPaC), dated January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of E ngineers,  New O rleans an d U.S. F ish a nd Wildlif e Service, E cological Services Office.   Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any  species listed as endangered by  the U.S. Departments of Commerce, nor affect any ha bitat designated as critical to the survival and r ecovery of such species.      This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requir ements of the Magnuson-S tevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alter ation of 37.9 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum  and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is  that the proposed action would hav e no adverse impact o n EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project i mpacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service. If the proposed work involves  deposits of dredged or fill material into nav igable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts  will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

This public notice is also available for review online at: https://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/Public -Notices/   Corps  of Engineers  Permit  Criteria   The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern  for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion , recreation,  water  supply  and conservation,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine  whether  to make,  modify,  condition,  or deny  a permit  for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,  historic  properties,  water  quality,  general  environmental  effects, and other  public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity .  The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National  Register  of Historic  Places  at or near the proposed work  but is pending further review  in accordance  with the National  Historic  Preservation Act. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, copies of this   public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources . 3  Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species. Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC)  tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  New Orleans  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, it has been  determined that the project would have no effect to any listed species.                 Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect  on any species             listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat             designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species .    This notice initiates  the Essential  Fish Habitat  (EFH) consultation requirements  of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of  0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexi co. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will  include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification  that the proposed activity  will not violate  applicable water  quality  standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a Department of the Army permit could be issued.   Any person may request within  the comment  period specified  in this notice,  that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing, and can be preferably  emailed to the USACE project manager listed above or mailed to the address listed above.   You are invited  to communicate the information contained  in this notice  to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.     Darrell  S.

If granted, the time extension will be continuous and inclusive of the initial comment period and will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. This public notice is also available for review online at https://go.usa.gov/xennJ  Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, gener al environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.  This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165-2- 220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.  The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors:  1)Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will bereviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project condi tions, purposes or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.  2)Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will bereviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as -3-conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources, environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This evaluation will consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes, agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest .  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.   Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project. The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The possibility exists  that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.  Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.  The New Orleans District has determined that the work  is located in waters known to be utilized by the endangered P allid Sturgeon and the threatened West Indian Manatee and provided the determination that the activity is not likely to adversely affect these species based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 0 acres of EFH -4-utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.

The Branch Chief  will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request.  If granted, the time extension will be continuous and inclusive of the initial comment period and will not exceed a total of 30 calendar day s.  Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria   The decision whether to issue a Section 10/404 permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The b enefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced  against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those  are conservation, economics,  aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,  water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.  3  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the p ublic, federal, state, and local  agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determ ine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest fact ors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to det ermine the overall public interest of the  proposed activity.    The New Orleans Distric t is unaware of a ny properties  listed on the National Register of Historic Places near the proposed work.  The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or  destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  As deemed necessary, c opies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any s pecies listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.   Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it has been determined that the project would have no effect to the Red- cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) or the  Gopher Tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) .  This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal is not expected to  result in the destruction or alteration  of EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our  final determ ination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity  will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of  Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications , before a permit is issued.   Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.   4  You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulati ve effects associated with the proposed project.  The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.     The New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places at or near the proposed work but is pending further review in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act . The possibility exists  that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Hist oric Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.    Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.   -4-   Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it has been determined that the project is not likely to adversely affect the West Indian Manatee ( Trichechus manatus ), determined as threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species .   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson -Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.    If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.     Any person may request, (preferably by email to the project manager, or in writing), within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.

This public notice is also available for review online at https//go.usa.gov/xennJ  Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, inclu ding cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165 -2-220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that  reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors   1) Potent ial to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions,  purposes or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   -3-  2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine the probable i mpacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources, environmental impacts, water supply, water  quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This evaluation will consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes, agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest .    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, I ndian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a perm it for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activi ty.  Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.  The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.     New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places at or near the proposed work but is pending further review in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act . The possibility exists  that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.

This public notice is also available for review online at https://go.usa.gov/xennJ  Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, inclu ding cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165 -2-220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that  reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors:   1) Potent ial to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions,  purposes or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.   -3-  2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine the probable i mpacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources, environmental impacts, water supply, water  quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This evaluation will consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes, agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest .    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, I ndian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a perm it for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activi ty.  Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.  The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.     New Orleans District is presently unaware of properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places at or near the proposed work but is pending further review in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act . The possibility exists  that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. As deemed necessary, copies of this public notice will be sent to the State Archeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally listed tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.    Based on the Information Planning and Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the provided the determination of a “ may affect, not likely to adversely affect  (NLAA) ” was concluded for the threatened West Indian Manatee.      This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's -4-  proposal may result in the destruction, alteration, and/or disturbance of 0  acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

This public notice is also available for review online at https//go.usa.gov/xennJ .          Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria   The decision whether to issue a Section 10/404 permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.     This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular 3  (EC) 1165-2-220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects. The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be evaluated by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors  1) Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.  2) Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be reviewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources, environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This evaluation will consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes, agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity. Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.  The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public interest.  Policy and legal compliance will also be considered.   The New Orleans District utilizes the National Register of Historic Places to identify properties listed on or near the proposed work.  The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which  reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably  foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including  the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general  environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local  agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,  condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the  proposed activity.   The New Orleans District is unaware of any p roperties  listed on the National Register of Historic Places near the proposed work.  The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  Issuance of this public notice solicits input from the State Archeologist and State Historic Preservation Officer regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.   Based on the Information & Planning Consultation for Endangered Species in Louisiana (IPaC ), dated January 27, 2020 between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans and U.S.  Fish and 3  Wildlife Service, Ecological Services Office , it has been determined that the act ivity is not likely to adversely affect the West Indian M anatee or the Pallid Sturgeon.  Standard Manatee Conditions for In-Water Activities will be added to the permit, if authorized.   Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversel y Affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to  the survival and recovery of such species.   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal is not expected to result in the destruction or alteration of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would have no adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures  is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.        If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, a certification that the proposed activity  will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of  Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications, befor e a permit is issued.        The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with  and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program.  The Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.   Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.   You are requested to communic ate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.        Brad P.

This request will also be reviewed pursuant to Section 408 and USACE Engineering Circular (EC) 1165-2- 220, which provides policy and procedural guidance for processing requests to alter USACE civil works projects.   The decision whether to grant permission for the requested alteration will be based on several factors.  The benefits that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal will be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  Review of the requests for modification will be reviewed by a USACE technical review team considering the following factors  1)Potential to Impair the Usefulness of the Project.  Proposed alterations will be     reviewed to determine whether the alteration would limit the ability of the USACE project   to function as authorized, or would compromise or change any authorized project conditions, purposes, or outputs.  If USACE determines that the usefulness of the authorized project would be impaired, the request will be denied.  3 2)Potential to be Injurious to the Public Interest.  Proposed alterations will be    revi ewed to determine the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the public      interest.  Factors that may be relevant to the public interest depend upon the type of      USACE project being altered and may include, but are not limited to, such things as      conservation, economic development, historic properties, cultural resources,      environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, floodplains, residual      risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and recreation.  This      evaluation will consider information received from the interested parties, including tribes,     agencies, and the public.  The decision whether to approve an alteration will be   determined by the consideration of whether benefits are commensurate with risks.  If the     potential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be      determined that the proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.  The Section 408 review will consider the potential impact to the usefulness of the     Federal project and whether the proposed alteration would be injurious to the public      interest.

Dredged material is proposed to be utilized  beneficially in the creation of shoreline fill,  bird sanctuary , or to construct island s.  The six-lake system is proposed to b e dredged to help improve water quality due to existing sedimentation, algae blooms, and low dissolved oxygen levels.  The project has been designed to detain a 100- year storm event to help provide stormwater retention improvements for the area.   Approximately 1,045,500  cubic yards of dredged waterbottoms from hydraulically dredged from project  activity and 26,852 c ubic yards of cl ean hauled in fill mater ial would be placed as fill material in jurisdictional areas.   The project would fill approximately  63.93 acres of jurisdictional Other Waters of the US waterbottoms and create upland habitat located along the  shorelines .  The project  also proposes to create approxi mately 32.42 acres of wetland habit at.  The project proposes to use approximately 14,453 linear feet of geote xtile tube to contain approximately 38,319 cubic yards of the dredged material .  Temporary bulkheads and laydown areas are also proposed during the construction stage of this proposed project a nd are indicated on the attached proposed project drawings.

LOCATION OF  WORK : Located on an approximate 300-acre site, in a six-lake system (University Lakes) , located  along and northwest  of Stanford Avenue, near Baton Rouge, in East Baton Rouge Louisiana, (lat.  30.4206, long.  -91.1678),  as shown within the attached drawings.  (Hydrologic Unit Code 080070202 Pontchartrain Basin ).  CHARACTER OF WORK:  The applicant has requested Department of the Army authorization to dredge and place waterbottoms material as fill to implement the University Lakes Aquatic Restor ation and Flood Risk Reduction Project.  Dredged material is proposed to be utilized  beneficially in the creation of shoreline fill,  bird sanctuary , or to construct island s.  The six-lake system is proposed to b e dredged to help improve water quality due to existing sedimentation, algae blooms, and low dissolved oxygen levels.  The project has been designed to detain a 100- year storm event to help provide stormwater retention improvements for the area.   Approximately 1,045,500  cubic yards of dredged waterbottoms from hydraulically dredged from project  activity and 26,852 c ubic yards of cl ean hauled in fill mater ial would be placed as fill material in jurisdictional areas.   The project would fill approximately  63.93 acres of jurisdictional Other Waters of the US waterbottoms and create upland habitat located along the  shorelines .  The project  also proposes to create approxi mately 32.42 acres of wetland habit at.  The project proposes to use approximately 14,453 linear feet of geote xtile tube to contain approximately 38,319 cubic yards of the dredged material .  Temporary bulkheads and laydown areas are also proposed during the construction stage of this proposed project a nd are indicated on the attached proposed project drawings.  Remnant vegetative debris and cypress stumps are also proposed to be   2    removed as a result of project implementation.  The proposed project currently has a jurisdictional wetland determination pending with our Jurisdiction and Enforcement Branch.   An addendum Public Notice may be required  if the ju risdictional determination  determines that additional  project related impacts to wetlands  are pr esent.    The project proposes to impact approxim ately  3.13 acres of potentially jurisdictional  wetlands (black willow habitat and fringe herbaceous  wetland habitat) .  Approximately 275 acres of jurisdictional Other Waters of the US  would be directly impacted as a result of project implementation from hydraulic dredging of waterbottom material .  The project proposes to utilize the dredged material beneficially through creation of wetland and upland habitat adjacent to and within the University Lakes system .  The applicant proposes to utilize best m anagement practices for erosion and siltation control during and after the construction phase of the project.   Post dredging, the applicant proposes to install boardw alks, retaining walls, pedestrian walkways, and other appurtenances  to improve the existing May Street  with a proposed bridge to increase connectivity between City Park Lake and University Lake.   If authorized, the project will receive approval from all appropriate local drainage authorities .  The project is proposed as a ben eficial project and no compensatory mitigation has been proposed by the applicant due to the proposed  benefits assoc iated with the project .  The comment  period  on the requested Department  of the Army  Permit  will close 20 days from the date of  this public notice.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria         The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, 3  modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity. Further, all factors that may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the potential cumulative effects associated with the proposed project.    The New Orleans District utilizes the National Register of Historic Places to identify properties listed on or near the proposed work and is presently unaware of non-listed eligible properties near the project site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. However, extent of impacts is undetermined at this time pending a National Historic Preservation Act compliance determination. As deemed necessary, copies of this notice are made available to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer, and federally recognized Native American tribes regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.        Our initial finding is that the proposed work would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species under their jurisdiction.     Utilizing the Information & Planning Consultation (IPaC) tool for Endangered Species in Louisiana protocol, as signed on January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (CEMVN) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, CEMVN has determined that the proposed activity would have no effect to any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any such species.
