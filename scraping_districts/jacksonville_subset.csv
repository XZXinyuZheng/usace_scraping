CULTURAL RESOURCES   The Corps is evaluating the undertaking for effects to historic properties as required under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. This public notice serves to inform the public of the proposed undertaking and invites comments including those from local, State, and Federal government Agencies with respect to historic resources. Our final determination relative to historic resource impacts may be subject to additional coordination with the State Historic Preservation Officer, those federally recognized tribes with concerns in Florida and the Permit Area, and other interested parties. ENDANGERED SPECIES  The Corps has determined the proposed project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the Green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas ), Kemp’s Ridley s ea turtle ( Lepidochelys kempii ), Loggerhead sea turtle ( Caretta caretta), Hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata ), Leatherback sea turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea), Smalltooth Sawfish ( Pristis pectinata), Manta ray (manta birostris ) and Gulf sturgeon ( Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi ) or its designated critical habitat. The Corps will request National Marine Fisheries Service concurrence with this determination pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. The Corps has determined, based on the use of The Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, and the State of Florida Effect Determination Key for the Manatee in Florida (April 2013) , that the proposed project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect the West Indian manatee with the inclusion of conditions a, b, c, d, and e of the Standard Manatee Conditions for In- water Work (2011) . ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT (EFH)  This notice initiates consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service on EFH as required by the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act 1996. Overwater impacts from the proposed project would total approximately 0.1 acre(5,054 square feet) and in- water impacts would total approximately 214 square feet of estuarine unvegetated bottom habitat utilized by various life stages of coastal migratory pelagic species in Massalina Bayou. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or Federally managed fisheries in the area. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service. 2 NAVIGATION  The proposed structure is not located in the vicinity of a federal navigation channel .

The project site is located at 215 South Ocean Shore Boulevard , in Section 12, Township 12 South, Range 31 East, Flagler Beach, Flagler County, Florida.","The applicant see ks authorization for the following  1.To work in a water of the United States (o pen, tidal water) to remove the existing pier. The demolition would include removal of the re maining 7,760-square-feet area of timber pier with extraction of 108 tim ber piles. More specifically , 388-feet by 20-feet-wide of existing pier would be removed. The existing timber pier will be re moved primarily using land-based equipment operating fr om the temporary construction trestle. The timber from the historical pier be colle cted as part of the demolition for future reuse. Therefore, care will be taken to carefully cut and remove all existing planks, handrails, joists, caps, braces, piles and any other timber element s during demolition. These items will then be transported to an upland storage location for so rting and distribution. Timber and metal connectors that will not be repurposed or rec ycled will be removed to an upland location and disposed of appropriately. The contractor will make every effort to  remove all of the piles in their entirety with a pile extractor / vibratory hammer. If the piles break during removal, the contractor will have to cut the remaining pile at the mudline. A barge with crane and/or a support vessel for divers may also be needed to remove existing debris on the seafloor that could affect installation of the new concrete piles or if the piles need to be cut at the mudline. 2.To work in a water of the United Stat es (open, tidal water) to construct a 33,000-square-foot temporary constr uction trestle on the south side of the proposed new pier footprint. More specifically, the trestle would be 1,100-foot-long by  30-foot-wide that would include installation of 116 plumb piles that would be 24-inches-wide and made of steel pipe installed by vibratory hammer and/or impact hammer and/or jetting and installation of 116 batter piles HP 14x73 made of steel installed by vibratory hammer and/or jetting, a steel super structure, which includes caps, girders, and joists, and installation of timber decking with an elev ation of approximately 28-feet NAVD88. No more than 5 piles would be installed per day . The temporary construction trestle will be entirely removed once construction of the new pier is complete, which is expected to take approximately 24 days. T he temporary trestle would be 30-feet-wide by 170.27-feet to 202.69-feet-long (due to the angle) for the por tion of the structure located landward of the mean high water line (reference Sheet S-100) . The pile installati on related to the trestle would take approximatel y 50-54 days. The portion of the temporary trestle above the mean high water line is not under jurisdic tion of the Corps; however, the impacts would be reviewed under t he National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, and under the National Historic Preservation Act. 2 The actual temporary construction trestle ma terials will be determined according to the contractor’s preferences. Theref ore, alternative to installing the steel pipe piles and steel HP piles as identified above, 116 24-inch square concrete piles may instead be installed by impact hammer and/or jetting. This propos ed method of pile installation would take approximately 54 days. 3.To work in a water of the United States  (open, tidal water) to construct a new 20,840-square-foot pier. More specif ically, the pier would be 715- feet-long by 25-feet-wide from the mean high water line with a 20-feet-long by  32-feet-wide T-head. The T-head would be at 28-feet NAVD88. The proposed action would restore the pier to its historical length of 828 feet - established by  the existing submerged lands  lease - by retaining and repairing 82.5 feet of existing timber pier and replacing the waterward 715 linear feet of pier. The pier would include installation of 116 piles comprised of 24-inch-square prestressed concrete installed by impact ha mmer or jetting and no more than 4 piles would be installed per day. The pier woul d include construction concrete decking and timber breakaway deck panels. The pier woul d also include Americans with Disabilities (ADA) accessibility features which includes a 5% (1H20L) slope to the new pier deck elevation and ADA handrails, inst allation of a firewater syst em, fish cleaning stations and trash receptacles, benches, shade structur es, and marine turtle-friendly lighting.  Additional work not authorized by any permit, but reviewed under NEPA, ESA, and Section 106 would include work landward of  the mean high water line to repair the remaining 113-linear-feet of pier. The repairs would include instal lation of structural pile jackets, repair of pile caps, stringers and bracing, and replacement of connection hardware and tie-downs. Upon completion, the Flagler Beach Fishing Pier would be accessible to visitors and anglers both day and night. The pier woul d be open throughout the year. Estimated usage would vary daily and seasonally; however, recent records estimate 200 to 250 average daily visitors throughout the year. The applicant estimates between 250 to 300 anglers (not including other visitors) using th e pier per day during peak season. The pier would have an attendant during operational  hours, and the pier would include observation areas and fish cleaning stations.",Flagler County,,Flagler Beach,,-81.126280,29.479974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,715,,,,,,,,,0

A dock structure would allow access for the public and the City of J acksonville Water Taxi. In addition, the applicant seeks to dredge to remove sediments to allow for proper flow from a new outfall structure and discharge fill material into an existing intake structure. It is important to note a previous public notice was issued for the proposed project on July 6, 2022. The applicant has revised the proposed project, as described in this public notice. A Department of the Army Permit has not been issued. The proposed activities are described below. 1) Dock A – Construc tion of a 21- foot-long by 10- foot-wide fixed access pier, 80- foot-long by 6- foot-wide gangway, 138- foot-long by 12- foot-wide floating access pier, two 45-foot-long by 5- foot-wide catwalks, a 45- foot-long by 8- foot-wide catwalk, 275- foot-long by 12- foot-wide terminal platform, 332- foot-long by 12- foot-wide terminal platform, a 11-foot-long by 10- foot-wide fixed access pier, 80- foot-long by 6- foot-wide gangway, 12-foot-long by 10- foot-wide floating gangway landing, and a 26- foot-long by 8- foot-wide utility platform. Dock A would provide 22 slips and has a total over water surface area of 11,371 square feet. Of the 22 slips, 6 of the slips are traditional berths with dividing finger piers, and are dedicated for 45- foot vessels. Fifteen of the 22 slips are side tie berths, where vessels where vessels will berth alongside the floating dock, the number of side tie slips was figures using 60- foot typical vessels and accounted for room between the vessels.  The side- tie portion of Dock A is intended for day use and short -erm transient use by smaller vessels. The last slip is a 60- foot side tie slip at the west end of Dock A that will be dedicated for the City of Jacksonville Water Taxi. 2) Dock B – Construction of 87-foot-long by 10- foot-wide fixed access pier, 24- foot-long by 4- foot-wide gangway, 119- foot-long by 12- foot-wide floating access pier, two 55- foot-long by 6- foot-wide catwalks, two 65 -foot-long by 7- foot-wide catwalks, 142- foot-long by 12-foot-wide terminal platform and a 15- foot-long by 5- foot-wide utility platform. Dock B would provide a total of 12 slips and has a total overwater surface area of 5,823 square feet. The slips range in size from 55 feet to 65 feet. 3) Dock C – Construction of a 33- foot-long by 10- foot-wide fixed access pier, 80- foot-long by 6- foot-wide gangway, 289- foot-long by 16.4- foot-wide floating access pier, four 50-foot-long by 5- foot-wide catwalks, two 40 -foot-long by 5- foot-wide catwalk, and a 917-foot-long by 16.4- foot-wide floating wave attenuator and an 18’ x 20’ ut ility platform. Dock C would provide a total of 39 slips and has a total over water surface area of 22,045 square feet. Dock C features 12 traditional slips for typical vessels ranging in size from 20 feet to 50 feet. The shore parallel portion of Dock C features side tie docking for vessels of various size. There are 27 side tie berths available based on an average vessel of 60 feet and typical berth spacing. 2 4) Dock D – Construction of a 261 foot -long by 10- foot-wide access pier, six 45- foot-long by 5 -foot-wide catwalks, and a 100- foot-long by 10- foot-wide terminal platform, and a 15- foot-long by 5- foot-wide utility platform. Dock D provides a total of 16 slips and has a total overwater surface area of 4,964 square feet. All 16 slips will be on boat lifts, for 45-foot vessels. 5) Dock E – Construction of a 216- foot-long by 10- foot-wide access pier, six 36- foot-long by 4- foot catwalks, and an 82- foot-long by 10- foot-wide terminal platform. Dock E provides a total of 16 slips and has a total overwater surface area of 3,159 square feet. All 16 slips will be on boat lifts, for 36-foot  vessels. 6) Dock F – Construction of a 265- foot-long by 10- foot-wide access pier, four 40- foot-long by 4- foot-wide catwalks, four 36- foot-long by 4- foot-wide catwalks, 8 6-foot-long by 10-foot-wide terminal platform, and a 15- foot-long- by 5- foot-wide utility platform, 80- foot-long by 6- foot-wide gangway, and a 40- foot-long by 18- foot-wide kayak launch. Dock F would provide  a total of 20 slips and has an overwater surface area of 3,906 square feet. All 20 slips will be on boat lifts, 10 of the slips will accommodate typically 36 foot vessels and 10 of the slips will accommodate 40 foot vessels. 7) Dock G – Construction of a 360- foot long by 10- foot wide fixed pier with a 40- foot long by 10- wide prefabricated aluminum bridge section to span over an existing utility easement. Dock G will run parallel so shore and will provide access to Docks D, E and F and does not provide any additional vessel slips. Dock G has a total over water surface area of 3,600 square feet. 8) Kayak Access- Construction of an ADA accessible ramp will be constructed on the east side of the project area. Most of the proposed ramp will be constructed landward of the Mean High Water Line. The ramp will provide access to the small natural beach on the JEA owned parcel (080096 0600). JEA has an easement with the Communit y Development District that allows for this construction. The ADA accessible ramp for the kayak launch will connect to previously permitted board walk (SJRWMD permit # 165883- 4). The ramp will be constructed of either timber or aluminum and will be be 6 feet wide. At the top and bottom of the ramp a 8- foot by 20- foot platform will be constructed to allow for an accessible turnaround. An approximately 5- foot wide apron on FDOT#1 size river stone will be placed around the platform to tie into the existing adjacent grade. The river stone apron will also provide additional stability at the platform to shoreline interface. On the waterward side of the access ramp, a simple metal frame slide system will be mounted. The slide will allow suers to place their kayak within the metal frame, and slide it down to the beach grade, as opposed to carrying the kayak 3 down the ramp. The accessible ramp, platform and river stone apron will occupy 99 square feet of area waterward of mean high water. 9) Dredging- The mechanical dredging of 905 cubic yards of material from an approximate 15,703 square foot area to a depth of -3.3 feet , adjacent to an existing bulkhead where a previously permitted (SJRWMD Permit #165883- 2) outfall will penetrate the bulkhead. This dredging will allow the new outfall to flow properly. The dredged material will be dewatered on the upland property and then hauled off to a legal disposal site. The disposal site will be contained and no discharge of return water to the St. Johns River will occur. 10) Discharge of Fill Material -The applicant would discharge approximately 25,000 cubic yards of fill material into an existing intake structure to facilitate the construction of general buildings to include such uses as a restaurant, a marina office, and/or an office for water sports/vessel rentals. The existing depth of the intake structure is not known. Historic construction plans indicate a maximum dredge depth of -22 feet NAV88 within the intake structure. Furthermore, a 428- foot-long steel sheet pile bulkhead would be installed around the perimeter of the existing structure. 11) Concrete structures for demolition – The demolition of an existing concrete structure that extends approximately 150 feet into the St. Johns River. The work will be completed from barge over water. The debris will be hauled off site to a legal upland landfill. An existing concrete fuel pier would be removed by cutting and lifting techniques. Structures that cannot be completely removed would be cut at the mudline and surveyed.",Duval County,,Jacksonville,,-81.647028,30.316837,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The applicant ’s propose d renovation reorganizes the slip distribution for up to 79 slips . The project site is broken down into three distinct areas. Detail A ( North Basin ) is located in Coral Cr eek along the north side of the property. Detail B (East Peninsula) is a canal directly east of the main property. Detail C ( South Basin ) is for the south side of the property. North Basin (Detail A) – This site is characterized by mangroves shorelines, a natural embayment, the presence of the Coral Creek bridge, shallow seagrass areas, and relatively shallow depth. This area was one of the principal, and last, offloading site for the commercial fishin g vessels operating out of the existing docks in this basin. The controlling depth to the site is -4’ mean low water ( MLW ). The shoreline at this site is planned for commercial watersports. At the very north end is a proposed restaurant and bridge club ove rlooking the Coral Creek waterway. Continuing south along the shoreline will be commercial retail (The Village Plaza) that will include a spa and pool. There are proposed floating and fixed docks that include the following Dock A – From the upland captai ns walk an 8' wide x 24' long , 192 s quare foot (sf.) Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA) compliant ramp extends waterward connecting to an 8’ x 8’ platform (64 sf.), continuing to an 8' wide x 30' long (240 sf.) ADA compliant ramp terminating in the uplands . The total landward area is 496 sf . The ramp then continued onto an 8' wide x 16' long (128 sf.) fixed wood landing . The landing connects 2 to an 5' wide x 30' long (150 sf.) aluminum ramp that connects to the floating docks. The landing is an 8 ' x 8' (64 sf.) floating dock segment with an 8’ x 8’ triangle (32 sf.) providing access to a 6 ' wide x 2 16' long (1,296 sf.) floating dock with 7 slips up to 30’ long. This would be mooring for smaller vessels accessing the restaurant . The total dock area is 2,166 sf., with 1,670 sf. being over-water. Dock B – There are two ADA compliant access ramps off of the proposed upland captains walk that connect to a fixed wood dock. The first ramp begins with a 6’ x 6’ landing connecting to a 6’ wide x 30’ long ramp terminating in the uplands (216 sf.). The access ramp then continues with a 6’ x 6’ landing then continues down another 6’ wide x 12’ ramp ( 108 sf.) connecting to a fixed wood dock, Dock B. The second ramp further south begins with a 6’ x 6’ landing ( 36 sf.) along the uplands . It then continue s with a 6’ x 30’ long ramp ( 180 sf.) that connects to a 6’ x 6’ ( 36 sf.) landing and D ock B, which is 6' wide x 40 7' long (2,442 sf.) fixed wood dock . Three finger piers, 4’ wide x 30’ long (360 sf) contribute to a total mooring for 14 slips up to 25’ long. This dock will serve as mooring for boat rentals and other watercraft to include paddle craft rentals and zero emission electric boats. Total dock area is 3,378 sf., with 3,126 sf. being over water. Paddle Craft Beach – Extending off of the upland building deck is a series of ADA accessible ramps and landings, 6' wide , that terminate at a pa ddle craft beach area. It is bound by an upland retaining wall measuring 55’ and 75’ on each side, to hold beach quality sand in plac e. The existing site is a concrete boat ramp. The concrete would be removed and the beach sand placed above the mean high water line (MHW) to be compatible with paddle craft launching and retrieval.  East Peninsula (Detail B) – The east peninsula has an artificial canal that connects to the main access channel to Gasparilla Marina and the entrance to Coral Creek. The Concept Plan depicts detached bungalows and various upland improvements in this area. Long term mooring would be provided for the upland res idential development. Dock C – The proposal consists of a fixed wooden dock, 5’ wide x 290’ long (1,450 sf.) marginal to the shoreline . It is accessed on the west side by a 6’ wide x 10’ long (60 sf.) fixed access dock. At the north end a horseshoe shape d mooring area is proposed at 5’ wide x 25’ long (125 sf.) and 4’ wide x 30’ long (120 sf.) to replace the existing finger pier and boat lift. Slips 1 and 2 would be used for water taxi mooring to service the upland residential development, the Lighthouse Building and the four buildings shown on the east land mass. Slips 3 through 6, shown as 25’ long, and Slips 7 through 10, 30’ long would be long term mooring to service the upland condominiums. It should be noted that Slip 10 will be dedicated for law enf orcement mooring only to meet the state public interest test. The total dock area is 1,755 sf., with 10 slips . 3 South Basin (Detai l C) – This is the ma in marina for the site, with deep water access with controlling depths at -8’ MLW, providing mooring for larger vessels a t a fixed wooden dock that includes sewage pump out. This basin has historically been used by the commercial fishing fleet for deeper draft vessels like shrimp boats and offshore fishing vessels and is capable of supporting larger recreational vessels. The upland development plan for this site include s a building with three ballroom/conference areas, an open lawn area dedicated for special events like wedding s, and support facil ities for the inland hotel units. Access to Docks E, F and G - There are two access point s from the upland , both 8' wide x 30' long (480 sf.) via fixed wood access doc k. They conne ct to the Dock F, which is 8’ wide x 296’ long (2,368 sf.). Six (6) finger piers, 5’ wide x 40’ long (1,200 sf.) extend off this access dock.  Dock F connects to the east with Dock E, which is 8’ wide x 442’ long (3,536 sf.). Dock F also provides access to Dock G to the west, which is 8’ wide x 514’ long (4,112 sf.) The total dock area is 11,696 sf. over wate r providing a total of 48 slips . On Dock G, Slip #1 is dedicated for sewage pump out. The proposed structures for the en tire developmen t constitute a total of 18,995 sf. with 18,247 sf. being over water .  A riprap revetment, 20’ wide x 120’ long , is proposed behind Dock F, to stabilize the eroding shoreline and allow for natural recruitmen t of mangrove s once complete. Previou s efforts to add ress the erosion have been unsuccessful, including planting of mangrove s and sodding the slope. The area o f impa ct is 2,400 sf. (0.055 ac.) and the volume of fill is 267 cy. Additionall y, 8 channel marker pilings are also proposed to be replaced in the access channel. Piling – A total of 528 wood piles would be installed for the support of the docking structures.",Charlotte County,,Placida,,-82.26525,26.83238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Consideration was given to existing SAV beds by delineating their footprints in a 2019 survey, and the project was designed to avoid direct impacts to rooted sea grasses. The plans were designed to construct the project in water depths of less than 6 ft. to avoid hindering gulf sturgeon foraging and migration habits. Gaps in breakwaters and rock piles were provided to allow for movemen t of marine species and flushing of water. Depending on the time of year construction is planned, in-water work may need to be scheduled around the migratory period for gulf sturgeon to prevent deterrents to migration. Observers are anticipated on dredges and work vessels to monitor for the presence of sea turtles, manatees, and gulf sturgeon during construction activities. Construction would be conducted during daylight hours with a limited number of pilings (6-8) installed per day. Floating turbidity curtains (and/ or booms) are proposed during in-water work to prevent siltation and impacts to water quality and species. Once the breakwaters are installed, a system of breakwaters and floating turbidity curtains can be used to contain placed sand until grading and planting are completed, construction is completed, and the turbidity in the construction area is no greater than 29 NTUs above background levels. COMPENSATORY MITIGATION The applicant has provided the following explanation why compensatory mitigation should not be required ""No compensatory mitigation is proposed since the project is considered a habitat restoration project. The project purpose includes restoring habitats historically found in the Pensacola Bay System, including marshes, and facilitating expansion of existing seagrasses through natural recruitme nt. Habitats in the Pensacola Bay system have been lost or degraded over time due to anthropomorphic and environmental factors. Changes in the Pensacola Bay system include the decline of seagrasses and marsh (Environme ntal Quality of the Pensacola Bay System Retrospective Review for Future Resource Management and Rehabilitation). Benthic habitats and seagrasses that provide support for birds, fish, and other marine species have also been degraded or lost as a result of point source and non-point source pollution (Pensacola Bay System Surface Water Improvement and Manageme nt Plan). Project goals include restoring habitats with specific value for invertebra tes and coastal birds, finfish, and shellfish species and promoting the growth of submerged aquatic 6 vegetation.  The marsh creation w ould provide essential fish habitat (EFH) for species managed under the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) of 1996, including shrimp, Spanish mackerel, red drum, and snapper and grouper species.  The marsh w ould provide habitat for shrimp, crabs, and juvenile fish, which are prey species for fish managed under the MSFCMA.  The marsh habitat w ould also provide habitat support to birds, including but not limited to ibises, egrets, herons, gulls, and terns.  Both native and migratory bird species that winter or stop over in coastal areas of Florida w ould be able to utilize the marsh habitat.  The project is expected to create 71 acres of marsh habitat and promote up to 50 acres of natural recruitment of seagrasses. ” CULTURAL RESOURCES  The Corps is aware of recorded historic resources within or adjacent to the permit area and is evaluating the undertaking for effects to historic properties as required under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

The proposed new site would include the existing 0 .1 nm x 1 nm rectangular site of 84.7 acres in area and would add a new area to the northeast of the existing site. The new area would be a rectangle measuring 0.40 nm on the east -west axis by 0.68 nm on the north- south axis , encompass ing 209.3 acres of newly permitted seafloor , for a total of 294 acres. It is anticipated that 28 separate phases of patch reef deployments of approved reef materials would be made over the course of the permit depending on funding and suitable reef material availability. All reef materials would be consistent with reef materials referred in the publication Guidelines for Marine Artificial Reef Materials , 2nd Edition, which was produced by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission. All reef materials w ould also meet the expectations of the National Artificial Reef Plan, the state of Florida Artificial Reef Strategic Plan and the OAR Artificial Reef Development Pla n.

There would be a 200- foot separation between patch reefs .  DEPTH, PROFILE AND C LEARANCE  The depth at the proposed site ranges from -40’ on the north end to -60’ on the south end, relative to mean low low water. The maximum profile of any reef material would be 13 ’ at the north end of the site and 20’ feet at the south end of the si te. The minimum depth after deployment (navigational clearance) would be 27 ’ at mean low low water. CULTURAL RESOURCES   The Corps is evaluating the undertaking for effects to historic properties as required under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. This public notice serves to inform the public of the proposed undertaking and invites comments including those from local, State, and Federal government Agencies with respect to historic resources. Our final determination relative to historic resource impacts may be subject to additional coordination with the State Historic Preservation Officer, those federally recognized tribes with concerns in Florida and the Permit Area, and other interested parties.
