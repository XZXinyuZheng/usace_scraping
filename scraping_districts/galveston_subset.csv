LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:   27.83957  North;  Longitude:   97.069149 West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant proposes to repair and upgrade the existing ferry facility which would include work on bulkheads, breakwaters, mooring dolphins, and ferry slips.  Approximately 1,016 linear feet (LF) of steel sheet pile bulkhead would be placed approximately 1.5 feet in front of the existing bulkhead.  The bulkheads would include A -frame anchor walls that have concrete piles driven on land.  The existing breakwater on Mustang Island would be extended approximately 107 feet and would consist of ste el sheet pile combined with steel pipe.   The existing breakwater on        Harbor Island would be extended by constructing the bulkhead approximately 40 feet away from the existing  bulkhead , resulting in the permanent loss of 0.3 acre of          Section 10 waters.   At the base of the new bulkhead and breakwaters, approximately  1.46 acre s of 15 -inch and 18 -inch stone riprap would be placed.   At the Mustang Island landing, approximately 2,500 cubic yards of material would be dredged at slips 11 and 6.   The dredge material wil l be placed in an upland location outside of the Texas De partment of Transportation (TxDOT) right -of-way (ROW).   At the Harbor Island landing, the              27 existing mooring dolphins would be replaced with 24 monopile mooring dolphins.   At the Mustang Island landing, the 36 existing  cluster pile  dolphins would be replaced with 40 monopile mooring dolphins.   New monopile dolph ins would be a combination of          36-, 40-, and 60 -inch-diameter  monopiles.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The existing breakwater on Harbor Island will be extended approximately 40  feet to provide additional protection to that ferry landing .  This extension was  recommended based on an assessment of how a deeper channel and adjacent oil and gas facility could impact the ferry facility.  The planned extension is the minimum recommended to provide additional protection to the landing .  MITIGATION:   No mitigation proposed.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project review area is approximately 17.17 acres and includes the existing ferry facility, upland undeveloped habitat, open water with associated estuarine mud/soft bottom habitat, and sandy beach.  In front of the               ferry landing s, water depths range from 17 to 40 feet on the Harbor Island side of the channel and 10 to 28 feet on the Mustang Island side; the substrate within the channel consists of soft sand and clay.  There is a small section of sandy bea ch at both the Mustang Island side and Harbor Island side, which gently slopes down from mean high water (MHW) to between 10 and 20 feet once in -line with the existing ferry slips.   There is no oyster reef or seagrass present.  The depth, turbidity, and high  wave energy of this area do not support either seagrass or oyster  habitat .  In upland undeveloped habitat, vegetation is typical of disturbed south Texas coastal prairie and includes saltgrass (Distichlis spicata ), largeleaf pennywort ( Hydrocotyle bonarien sis), sandbur         (Cenchrus incertus ), Bermuda grass ( Cynodon dactylon ) and red lovegrass        (Eragrostis secundiflora ).  This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 20 sheets.     A preliminary review of this application indicates that an En vironmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.   Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant natu re.  Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA .  OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     Consistency with the State of Texas Coastal Management P lan is required.   The applicant has stated that the proposed activity complies with Texas’ approved Coastal Management Program goals and policies and will be conducted in a manner consistent with said program.   The proposed project will trigger review under  Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The TCEQ will review this application under Section 401 of the CWA and in accordance with Title 30, Texas Administrative Code Section 279.1 -13 to determine if the work would comply with State water quality standa rds.  The applicant has not yet reached out to the TCEQ to initiate the Section 401 CWA process.   LEAD FEDERAL AGENCY:   The TxDOT  has been identified as the lead federal agency for complying with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Magnuson -Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  As such, please direct all comments, questions, or  concerns regarding these Acts to the TxDOT .  NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES:   The staff archaeologist has  reviewed the latest published version of the National Register of Historic Places, lists of properties determined eligible, and other sources o f information.   The following is current knowledge of the presence or absence of historic properties and the effects of the undertaking upon these properties:    The permit area has been so extensively impacted by construction and  maintenance of the ferry landings that there is no potential for                 historic properties to exist within the permit area.  Therefore, the proposed project has no potential to effect historic properties.   The permit area has been so extensively impacted by construction and maintena nce of the ferry landings that there is no potential for resources of concern to the Native American Tribes to exist within the permit area.   THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES:   Threatened and/or endangered species or their critical habitat may be affected by the proposed work.  Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and/or the National Marine Fisheries Service will be initiated to assess the effect on endangered species.     ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT:   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat consultation requirements of the Magnuson -Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  TxDOT’s initial  determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on Essential Fish Habitat or federally  managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisherie s Service.   PUBLIC INTEREST REVIEW FACTORS:   This application will be reviewed in accordance with 33 CFR 320 -332, the Regulatory Programs of the Corps , and other pertinent laws, regulations and executive orders.

PROJE CT HISTORY:   SWG -2008 -00319 was issued on 1 April 2009 and  authorized the applicant to construct a 40 -foot by 60 -foot barge dock, 4  mooring dolphins, and                      6 breasting dolphins.  It also granted the applicant authorization to mechanically remove approximately 18,000  cubic  yards of sand/clay bottom material and to install approximately 2,447  cubic  yards of articulated block mattress (ABM) and approximately 5 cubic  yards of riprap for slope protection.  The placement area for the excavated material w ill be located on adjacent Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminals  (KM)  property north of Clinton Drive.  The placement area is located in uplands within a highly industrialized area.   A modification for SWG -2008 -00319 was issued on 1 5 July 2009 and authorized the applicant to add a 13.5 -foot-wide by 20 -foot-long platform on the northwest corner of a barge dock.   The platform will support a fire water pump and skid that is required to be installed to allow the terminal to be in full compliance with current fire prote ction requirements.   Dredging is not required and there are no alterations to shoreline protection.     A public notice was issued on 2 December 2021 to inform the public of proposed project modifications to  SWG -2008 -00319 , which include d the discharge of appr oximately 16,500  cubic  yards (0.06 acre) of clean back -fill material below the MHW line and within open water areas associated with the installation of an approximat e 905-linear -foot, sheet pile bulkhead wall, supported by batter piles.  Piles will be driv en from a barge mounted pile driving hammer stationed directly in front of the existing bulkhead wall .  During the Section 408 review process, it was determined that the applicant would be required to obtain a letter of no objection from the Port of  Houston  Authority (POHA) for the proposed project, as required for the processing of the  Section 408 authorization.   Upon request, the POHA indicated they would not provide a  letter of no objection for the proposed p roject as currently designed due to potential effects with  Project 12 Channel Improvements.   The proposed bulkhead alignment was revised to  avoid impacts due to future channel improvements associated with Project 12.  This revised bulkhead alignment was presented to the POHA for review on 29 March 2023.   Following their review, the POHA provided confirmation that the revised bulkhead  alignment would be acceptable for the issuance of a letter of no objection.   No additional objections were received during the previous public notice comment period.    NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Dredge Location  29.724237° North;           095.272111° West   On-site Dredge Material Placement Area Location  (Southern Slip)  29.721604° North;           095.274594° Wes t   PROJECT DESCRIPTION :  The applicant proposes modifications to previously authorized Department of the Army (DA) Permit SWG -1998 -02534 (formerly 14209) to mechanically dredge approximately 20,000  cubic  yards from a 1.39 -acre area of the Houston Ship Channel to maintain adequate depths and improve the func tionality of existing dry docks currently in use.  The applicant proposes to place approximately  10,000  cubic  yards  of the dredge material into an approximate 0.49 -acre open water area of the Houston Ship Channel directly adjacent to the dredge site along t he applicant’s southern slip to alleviate problems associated with a shallow basin caused by debris and sediment accumulation, and to create additional uplands to expand the us able footprint of the facility to serve as an equipment storage area.   Upon sedi ment sample collection and review of sediment test results, any dredge material not placed within the southern slip will be transported for off -site disposal at one of the following permitted landfills:  Republic McCarthy Road, Gulfwest  Republic Landfil l, Waste Management Alvin -Coastal Plains RDF, WM Seabreeze Landfill, or GFL/Fort Bend RL.  Prior to the discharge of dredge material into the southern slip, the applicant proposes to construct an approximate 165-linear -foot bulkhead to contain the material and create a continuous bulkhead  along the applicant’s property  to restore the historical footprint of the facility  prior to 1978 .  PROJECT HISTORY:   DA Permit 14209 was issued to Newpark Shipbuilding  and Repair, Inc on  10 January 1980, and authorized the performance of maintenance dredging in the Houston Ship Channel, and in the Old Buffalo Bayou Channel located behind                Brady Island, as well as the placement of dredged material into the Clinton, House Tract, or Glendale  Dredge Material Placement Areas.  Amendment 14209(01), issued on           30 December 1984, authorized an extension of time to perform maintenance dredging and authorized the dredging of two existing basins and a boat slip located at the          Brady Island Facility.   Amendment 14209(02), issued on 26 December 1991, authorized periodic maintenance dredging, for a ten -year period, in an area adjacent to the              East Point bulkheads at the Brady Island Facility.   The dredged material was to be placed into one of the three previo usly authorized dredged material placement areas.  Amendment 14209(03), issued on 19 May 1997, authorized the construction of an extension onto Dry Dock Number 2.  Amendment 14209(04), issued on 13 January 1999, authorized the addition of a dredged materia l placement area at 1600 N orth Whittier Avenue , in Pasadena, Harris County, Texas.   Amendment 14209(05) was issued on         17 June 2003, and authorized an extension of time to perform maintenance dredging in two boat slips.   Amendment 14209(06) was issued on 17 Decemb er 2003, and authorized the use of mechanical dredging techniques and the addition of the Rosa Allen and       West Jones placement areas.   14209(07) was issued 16 November 2006, and authorized maintenance dredging activities in a 2.89 -acre area for a 10 -year period and to discharge dredged material into a 0.54 -acre portion of open water along the southern slip.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by limiting the proposed dredge  and fill activities to the immediate vicinity of the existing dry dock and the southern slip  within the previously authorized project area (s).   MITIGATION:   No compensatory mitigation is proposed as the project does not impact special aquatic sites.   CURR ENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  is located within  and adjacent to  the Houston Ship Channel, compris ing of  various maritime facilities including barge, boat, and ferry amenities, along with an Offshore Supply Vessels (OSV) maintenance and repair center.   Southwest Shipyard’s facility offers various services, such as new construction and fabrication, and encompa sses commercial  structures like an office, fabrication shops, maintenance areas, storage spaces, a barge slip, and dry docks .  The proposed d redging activities will occur in existing dry dock zones used for barge and vessel repair  within open water areas  of the Houston Ship Channel  that have been recognized as Estuarine and Marine Deepwater habitats.   The proposed fill area, the Southern Slip, once a marine railway, is no longer functional due to sediment accumulation.

The applicant stated that the purpose of the project is to  add to the required improvements to the existing infrastructure for the continued use of the applicant’s existing facility.   The modifications would help to aid the applicant in operational efficiencies and their strategic corporate initiatives.   BACKGROUND:  DA Permit No. 8225 was originally issued to Crown Central Petroleum Corporation on 18 June 1970 and authorized the construction of a T -head wharf , installation of nine 22 -pile framed breasting dolphins and dredging an area in the   Houston Ship Channel on the  right descending side at Channel Mile 43 and Corps of Engineers Station 976+60, approximately 0.23 -mile downstream from the             Wash burn Tunnel at Pasadena, Texas.   Approximately 137,000 cubic yards of material was to be removed and placed in the Jesse Jones spoil area located approximately         1.2 miles to the northeast.  The time to complete this authorized work was                              31 December 1973.   DA Permit 8225(01) was issued on 11 January 1984 and amended the permit to autho rize the maintenance of a timber L -head pier, five 22 -pile                 framed dolphins, and three 30 -inch steel pipe dolphins adjacent to the originally authorized work in the vicinity of Corps of Engineers Station 984+00, approximately    0.10-mile do wnstream from the Washburn Tunnel, on the right descending bank of the Houston Ship Channel.   Special Condition A was also added to the permit.   The time to complete the work under this amendment was 31 December 1989.   DA Permi t                  No. 82 25(02) was issued to Crown Central Petroleum Corporation on 3 February 1987  and amended the per mit to authorize the replacement of the existing timbe r loading platform with a new concrete and steel platform structure, replacement of two existin g dolphins , and construction of four new mooring structures landward of the bulkheads in the vicinity of Corps of Engineers Station 984+00, approximately 0.10 -mile downstream from the Washburn Tunnel, in the Houston Ship Channel, Harris County, Texas.  On        15 April 1987, a revision of Sheet No. 2 was approved which showed the corrected distance from the fenderline  to the south bottom edge of the channel.  DA Permit 8225(02) was transferred to Pasadena Refining System, Inc. on 24 February 2005.     AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by utilizing existing infrastructure while minimizing the required construction activity at the project site .  The applicant also stated that they designed the project to avoid and/or minimize impacts to wetlands and           water bottoms to the maximum extent practicable.  Additionally, there are no special aquatic sites identified within the project boundary.   MITIGATION:   The applicant has not proposed to mitigate for the proposed impacts because the project involves the installation of structures and there are no impacts to special aquatic site s.  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  consists of a portion of the            Houston Ship Channel.   This portion of the Houston Ship Channel is highly developed with industrial facilities and marine terminals and experiences heavy vessel traffic.  There are numerous structures such as piers,  boat lifts, aids to navigation, boat ramps, etc. , within the project area.  There are no special aquatic sites located within the project boundary .  This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project informat ion has not been verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 9 sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, thi s        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protectio n Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the Clean Water Act (CWA).   OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     Consistency with the State of Texas Coastal Management Plan is required.   The applicant has stated that the proposed activity complies with Texas’ approved Coastal Management Program goals and policies and will be conducted in a manner consistent with said program.   Pursuant to 33 USC 408, the proposed project will require Section 408 coordination and review.  This is a requirement for activities tha t seek permission, to temporarily or permanently, alter, occupy, or use a federally authorized United States Army Corps of Engineers civil works project.  Changes to the proposed project, from the Section 408 process, may warrant additional coordination.     NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES:   The staff archaeologist has  reviewed the latest published version of the National Register of Historic Places, lists of properties determined eligible, and other sources of information.  The following is current know ledge of the presence or absence of historic properties and the effects of the undertaking upon these properties:    The permit area has been so extensively impacted by industrial development that there is no potential for historic properties to exist within the permit area.  Therefore, the proposed project has no potential to effect historic properties.    THREATENED AND  ENDANGERED SPECIES:   Preliminary indications are that no known threatened and/or endangered species or their critical habitat will be affected by the proposed work.   ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT:   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat consultation requirements of the Magnuson -Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on Essential Fish Habitat or federally  managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

MITIGATION:   No permanent impacts to aquatic resources are expected; therefore, no mitigation is proposed .  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project crosses the Laguna Madre, through       59.80 acres of tidal waters within the ROW.  The Laguna Madre is a shallow, primarily flat bay with an average depth of approximately -3 feet through most of the project area.  A few dredged channels with  depths greater than -7 feet can be found throughout   Laguna Madre and crossing the project ROW, including the federally maintained GIWW.  Seagrasses are prevalent within the project ROW as well as several mature stands of  black mangrove ( Avicennia germin ans).  Also present are manmade islands constructed from material dredged from the GIWW and other channels that have potential use as    bird rookeries.

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude :  26.96794  North;   Longitude:   97.16263  West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant proposes to construct a shoreline restoration project that involves the following improvements:  (1) construction of two native fill templates each measuring approximately 250 -foot long, (2) construction of one offshore breakwater measuring 200 -foot-long by 80 -foot-wide, (3) construction of two shore -attached groins, each approximately 140 -foot-long by 80 -foot-wide, and (4) construction of two scour protection areas located within gaps between the offshore breakwater and shore -attached groins measuring 100 -foot-long by 80 -foot-wide, each.  Suitable fill material  to construct the fill templates would be obtained from the excavation of the   Scour Protection Areas, placed at the Native Fill Material Beneficial Placement Areas shown in the attached drawings on six sheets.  If the material is not beach quality, it would  be hauled off site, and native fill material from approved sand sources located at               Isla Blanca County Park or riverine sand from the Olmito Sand Pit may be utilized.   The proposed offshore breakwater and groin structures would be constructed using either armor and bedding stone, or an alternative material type/units composed of concrete, steel, mesh, geogrid, geotextile, stone, piles, chains, anchors, oyster shell, or similar.  Scour protection installation would include excavation and fill consisting of                   marine mattress material as a means to prevent scour within the gaps of the structures.   The stated purpose of the project is to protect the shoreline from erosional forces caused by daily wave action, storm -related events and ship wakes from vessels traversi ng through the Brazos Santiago Pass by utilizing a combination of non -structural (native fill) and structural (breakwater, groins, scour protection) methods.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by avoiding impacts to jurisdictional wetlands and special aquatic sites, including se agrass and oysters.  Best Management Practices (BMPs) such as silt curtains and silt fencing would be utilized during excavation and placement of native fill material,  placement of material for constructing the offshore breakwater and two shore -attached groins, and placement of scour protection material to minimize impact to adjacent wetlands and special aquatic sites.  Immediately befor e construction, a seagrass survey would be performed by the applicant and final adjustments to the positions of the proposed breakwater and groins would be made to ensure complete avoidance of all existing seagrasses.   MITIGATION:  No mitigation is being p roposed since there would be no permanent impacts to jurisdictional wetlands or aquatic resources (seagrass, oysters, mangroves).  The project footprint would only encompass current areas of unvegetated bay bottom .  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  Currently, the shoreline at the site  appears highly eroded and  consists of concrete rubble debris, relic timber pilings, and a 75 -foot rubble mound structure near a public boat ramp.  The project area consists of two primary vegetation communities – estuar ine high marsh wetland dominated by shoregrass,        sea oxeye daisy,  marshhay cordgrass, and saltgrass;  Uplands dominated by sea oxeye daisy, eastern prickly pear cactus, sea coastal bluestem, seashore paspalum, and associated species.  The wetlands along the project shoreline are of low quality and habitat value due to ongoing erosion.  Wetlands extending into the interior of the project area are of higher habitat value and are subject to inundation under high tide events.   A seagrass bed consisting of shoalgr ass, manatee grass, and stargrass is present near the project area.     NOTES:  This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.   As of the date of this public notice, the Corps has received but not yet verified the wetland delineation.  The applicant’s plans are enclosed in six sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.   Since permit asse ssment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA .  OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     Consistency with the State of Texas Coastal Management Plan is required.  The applicant has stated that the p roposed activity complies with Texas’ approved Coastal Management Program goals and policies and will be conducted in a manner consistent with said program.

CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is bordered on the west by a mixture of commercial and residential development along the shoreline of Galveston Bay, and on the north, east, and  south by the waters of Galveston Bay.  The shoreline along this portion of Galveston Bay at this location contains an existing pier structure and four previously authorized groin structures that contain an engineered sandy beach along the shoreline.  The shoreline beyond these groin structures contain existing rock riprap as bank stabilization.   Department of the Army Permit 23069 was issued on 7 November 2003 and expired on 31 December 2008 and authorized stabilization of 1,700 feet of the shoreline by constructing a revetment and 4 groins.  The revetment will consist of 4,500 cubic yards of crushed stone, riprap, and cellular concrete mattress within 0.75 -acre area along the shoreline of Galveston Bay.  The groins will consist of 4,200 cubic yards and be 200 feet long, each, covering a total of 0.75 -acre within Galveston Bay.  Located between the two groins, two separate beach areas, totaling 3.5 acres, meas uring 500 feet long by 150 feet wide, will be created by placing 25,000 cubic yards of sand.  Temporary barge access channels will be utilized to facilitate removal of existing dilapidated timber piles and for construction of the revetment and groins.  The stockpiled dredge  material will be protected from erosive wave forces by a temporary wave break.     The material  dredged for the temporary barge channel will be reused to backfill the channels upon completion  of the project. The total area of fill associate d with this project will be 5 acres.

AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  No wetlands will be filled and no SAV or oyster impacts are associated with this project.  The breakwater and reef structures have been designed to minimize impacts to the greatest extent practicable.   Remnant shell is expected as the survey site includes the footprint of the legacy reef and there is           oyster habitat in areas outside of the project area.   Wave energy influences the scattered shell that is in the project area, and that, along with the lack of larger material prohibits shell massing.   The submerged portions of the proposed project ( both reef rows and breakwaters) provide hard substrate suitable for oyster spat settlement.   The proposed project will create 6.7 acres of hard rock surface area substrate and 16.5 acres of cultch surface area (both) below mean high water suitable for colon ization by oysters and other sessile organisms.   MITIGATION:   The applicant does not propose mitigation compensation for this proposed project, as the breakwaters are a component of a living shoreline restoration activity, and the oyster reef restoration p roposes to  restore 23.7 acres of resource habitat and provide  additional storm risk management benefits.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  This nearshore/ open water portion of Matagorda Bay is an estuarine system  that contains unconsolidated bottom sediments and is subtidally influenced.  Matagorda  Bay is moderately developed and experiences moderate to heavy vessel traffic from the  adjacent navigation channel .  Oliver Point has experienced the cumulative habitat loss of more than 40  acres of wetlands,  more than 30 acres of        oyster reef, and 10 acres of shell ridge around Oliver  Point since 1965.   There are no recreational or commercial structure s located within the  vicinity of the action area.   There are no special aquatic sites, critical habitats, or oyste rs present within the project area .  NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 20 sheets.     A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.

This is a modification to a previously authorized permit.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that the project will not interfere with navigation, natural coastal processes, and avoids/minimizes shading .  MITIGATION:   Due to the size and scope of the project, there is little potential to affect resources.  No mitigation is proposed.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  is currently a  heavily developed portion of the Sabine -Neches Waterway .  There are numerous loading docks, ramps,  aids to navigation,  and monopiles in the adjacent vicinity.  The area is void of aquatic vegetation and experiences heavy vessel traffic.    NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 5 sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicates that an  Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     Consistency with the State of Texas Coastal Management Plan is required.   The applicant has stated that the proposed activity complies with Texas’ approved Coastal Management Program goals and policies and will be c onducted in a manner consistent with said program.   NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES:   The staff archaeologist has reviewed the latest published version of the National Register of Historic Places, lists of properties determined eligible, and other sources of information.  The following is current knowledge of the presence or absence of historic properties and the effe cts of the undertaking upon these properties:    The permit area has been so extensively impacted by industrial development that there is no potential for historic properties to exist within the permit area.  Therefore, the proposed project has no potential  to effect historic properties.   THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES:   Preliminary indications are that no known threatened and/or endangered species or their critical habitat will be affected by the proposed work.     ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT:   This notice initi ates the Essential Fish Habitat consultation requirements of the Magnuson -Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on Essential Fish Habitat or feder ally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   PUBLIC INTEREST REVIEW FACTORS:   This application will be reviewed in accordance with 33 CFR 320 -332, the Regulatory Programs of the Corps , and other pertinent laws, regulations  and executive orders.  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefits, which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors, which may be relevant to the proposal, will be considered:  among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics,                               general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water s upply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety,              food and fiber production, mineral needs and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.

The DA permit application was first publicized by an extended Public Notice issued on March  2, 2018.   The Proposed Action  is located north of the existing Dow Chemical Harris Reservoir in the city of Angleton, Brazoria County, Texas ( 29.267725˚N, -95.543750˚W ). The Proposed Action  would include the construction of a 1,929- acre impoundment with a storage capacity of 51,000 acre-feet, an intake and pump station to divert water from the Brazos River, and an outlet and emergency spillway to Oyster Creek. The proposed Action  would also include temporary construction staging and laydown areas , floodplain enhancements and stream restoration in Oyster Creek , and off-site compensatory mitigation along Big Slough. The Big Slough mitigation site is an approximately 1,100- acre area located on D ow property seven miles east of Lake Jackson near the Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge.   PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT : The Corps published a notice of intent and initiated the scoping process in the Federal Register  to notify the public of the intent to prepare a D raft EIS on April 9, 2020. A meeting invitation was emailed to federal and state agencies on April 28, 2020, and a virtual agency scoping meeting was held on May 12, 2020. Notices to interested parties and local, state, and federal elected officials were sent via mail and email on May 27, 2020, providing information about the Proposed Action, announcing the public meeting scheduled for June 17, Special Public Notice: SWG -2016-01027  2 2020, and providing a link to the Project website. Additionally,  on May 27, 2020, an Affected Party Letter was mailed to 25 affected parties providing information about the proposed Action, the link to the Project website, and an invitation to the June 17, 2020, virtual public meeting. The Corps solicited comments on t he proposed Action during the scoping period meetings from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Native American tribal groups, and other interested parties for the proposed permit activity.   On April 8, 2022, t he Corps published a special public notice invit ing full public participation on the potential concerns surrounding the D raft EIS. In addition, participation by federal, state, local agencies and other interested organizations was  encouraged. Two (2) virtual public meetings  were  held online on May 3, 2022 , to provide information about the p roposed Action  and to receive public input and comment on the Draft EIS. The D raft EIS was available for a public review period beginning on April 8, 2022,  and ending on June 20, 2022.   Comments from the public, Federal, State, and local agencies and officials, Indian tribes, and other interested parties regarding the impacts of this proposed activity  were considered  by the Corps to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for the proposed Action. Comments were considered in the Final EIS analysis pursuant to NEPA.   The Final EIS will be used to inform the Corps ’ decisions regarding Dow’s  permit application and may inform the decisions of other agencies that evaluate the  Proposed Harris Reservoir Expansion Project as part of their regulatory or permit processes. The information in the Final EIS will help decision makers, public officials, and citizens to understand the potential  environmental impacts of the proposed Harris Reservoir Expansion Project and its alternatives before decisions  regarding the proposed P roject are made.   Comments may be submitted during the entire 30-day review period and will be reviewed and incorporated into the administrative record prior to the Corps’ finalization of the procedure.   All comments pertaining to this Notice must reach this office on or before July 1 7, 2023.  Electronic (email) comments regarding the Final EIS should be addressed to SWG201601027@usace.army.mil .

It is located approximately 1 mile west of State Highway (SH) 35, 0.5 -mile north of Heights Road, and 0.3-mile east of Pearland Sites Road within the Clear Creek watershed in the San Jacinto – Brazos River basin,  northeast Brazoria County, Texas .    LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Parent Tract: Latitude:   29.482700 North ;  Longitude:   -95.274067 West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   Proposed Mitigation Bank Prospectus .  The Sponsor proposes the establishment and operation of a wetland mitigation bank  to be named the Clear Creek Regional Mitigation Bank.  The Sponsor’s plan is to restore approximately 166 acres of riverine forested (RF) wetlands;  enhance approximately 2 acres of                 RF wetlands;  establish approximately 83 acres of mixed RF and riverine herbaceous/shrub (RHS) wetlands;  re-establish site hydrology to allow for physical retention and chemical sequestration of local site run off and Chigger Creek floodwaters;  and promote stand diversity via selective plantings and forest management techniques to increase site flora and fauna biodiversity .  The project work is being conducted within the Clear Creek -frontal Galveston Bay  USGS Hy drologic Unit Code 1204020401  to serve as compensatory mitigation for unavoidable, permitted impacts to waters of the                United States.      AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The specific objectives of the project are to restore the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the site.   MITIGATION:   The applicant proposed to construct a compensatory mitigation bank .  WATER RIGHTS ACQUISITION  / TX SURFACE WATER USE, AVAILABILITY  & ASSURANCES  FOR LONG TERM HYDROLOGIC SUSTAINAB ILITY OF A MITIGATION BANK :  The site  sufficiency evaluation elements as defined in the            2008 Mitigation Rule direct the Corps  to take into account watershed scale features such as aquatic habitat diversity, habitat connectivity, and relationships to hydrologic sources (including the availability of water rights) .  The rule states this consideration should  begin at the Prospectus Phase  of mitigation bank proposal review.  Based on individual  state water use/apportionment  laws, this rule-required siting consideration is more pertinent to some Corps districts than others  in assessing the hydrologic sustainability of a mitigation bank  plan relative to t he site where it is proposed .    In the State of Texas, landowner right to use o f “surface” waters is not assured based on waterway proximity.   At the time of a mitigation bank proposal, bank -needed surface waters may have been previously allocated to another interest or may later be assigned to a competing interest if a surface water right is not o r cannot be secured  to meet a bank  project ’s needs .        Therefore, the Corps recommends that Texas  sited bank projects that have a need for surface water use (exclud ing direct precipitation or groundwater) submit a complete w ater right application to the TCEQ.  This application must  be consistent with the representations of hydrogeomorphic model s and other  information presented to the Corps.   If the bank applicant cannot secure Texas Water Rights for a proposed bank  site and project  plan, the Corps may otherwise be able to meet its hydrology sustainability assessment due diligence by requir ing additional site and surrounding area hydrology information  to be provided by t he applicant.  The Corps will make a determination if a site is considered an acceptable location for the proposed mitigation banking project on a case -by-case basis.   The bank applicant states the project is not required by the TCEQ to obtain a water rights permit  and that a wate r right may not be issued based on the proposed project plan .  Therefore, the Corps will require additional hydrology information including site and vicinity hydrology use and demand information to assess long term hydrologic sustainability risk and site suitability per the 2008 Mitigation Rule.     CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The site appears to have historically been part of a Chigger  Creek riparian forest that was converted to agriculture prior to 19 44.  The Bank has been maintained predominantly as open land and used for farming since th en.  Three irrigation reservoirs were excavated between 1944 and 1969 on the northern portion of the project area and were constructed to support agricultural production (rice farming).  Other infrastructure such as canals, contour levees, and drainage ditches can still be observed within the project area and a transmission line corridor was constructe d between 2002 and 2004.  The site contains two road easements (20’  wide/per ), the one transmission line ease ment (80’ wide) , 5 known plugged oil/gas wells and one plugged dry hole.   The property had a residence that was constructed prior to 1989 and was l ater cleared.   A wetland delineation was completed in October 2021, which identified 17 palustrine forested wetlands, 9 palustrine scrub -shrub wetlands, 18 palustrine emergent wetlands, and 3 palustrine, unconsolidated bottom (PUB) areas.   Additionally, t here is one perennial stream, and two upland drainage ditches.   Based on an approved jurisdictional determination, issued 30 September 2022 (Appendix B).   Of these site aquatic resources, six wetlands and two upland drainage ditches (totaling 46.74 acres and 2,381 linear feet) were determined by the USACE to be non -jurisdictional.    The Bank is almost entirely located in the 100-year floodplain of Chigger Creek.  Based on consultant modeling, a 4 -inch rainfall event represents the amount at which         Chigger Creek would significantly overtop its banks and approximately 233 acres of the site would be inundated in a typical year event.   Some site areas ar e dominated by notable species such as Chinese tallow, poison ivy, southern dewberry, and annual ragweed.   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant .  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.  As of the date of this public notice, the Corps has received and finalized the verification of the W etland Delineation .  The Functional Assessment  Verification is currently under review .  The applicant’s prospectus & associate d documents are  enclosed in 44 sheets .   A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.  Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA.     OTHER AGENCY AUTHO RIZATIONS:    The project does not appear to have a TPWD regulated stream use or impact  that would trigger a specific permitting component .   The project site is not located within the Texas Coastal Zone and therefore, does not require certification from th e Texas Coastal Management Program.   NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES:   The staff archaeologist has reviewed the latest published version of the National Register of Historic Places, lists of properties determined eligible, and other sources of information  relative to this proposed project .  The following is current knowledge of the presence or absence of historic properties and the effects of the undertaking upon these properties:    The permit area was previously investigated for historic prope rties,  and none were identified as documented in the report titled “An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the 330 -acre Clear Creek Mitigation Bank, HCFCD Project ID: A700 -01-00-Y001, Brazoria County, Texas” prepared by BGE, Inc. January 2022.   In addi tion, t he Texas Historical Commission reviewed the cultural resources survey results and provided concurrence to HCFCD on 25 February 2022 , that no historic properties are present or will be affected by the proposed project.   THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPEC IES:  Preliminary indications are that no known threatened and/or endangered species,  or their critical habitat will be affected by the proposed work.   PUBLIC INTEREST REVIEW FACTORS:   This application will be reviewed in accordance with 33 CFR 320 -332, the Regulatory Programs of the Corps , and other pertinent laws, regulations and executive orders.  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefits, which reasonably may be expected to accrue f rom the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors, which may be relevant to the proposal, will be considered:  among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics,                               general environme ntal concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety,              food a nd fiber production, mineral needs and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.

The applicant would  compensate for the con version (fill) of 0.27 acres of waterbody (manmade ditch).   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  currently bisects an improved tract of land that borders aquatic environments associated with Corpus Christi Bay to the west and SH 361 along with r esidential communities to the east .  The project site appears to be populated  primarily  by upland herbaceous vegetation .  This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 8 sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicates that an E nvironmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA.     OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     Consistency with the State of Texas Coastal Management Plan is required.   The applicant has stated that the proposed activity complies with Texas’ approved Coastal Management Program goals and policies and will be conducted in a manner consistent with said program.   This project incorporates the req uirements necessary to comply with the                         Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s (TCEQ) Tier I project criteria.  Tier I projects are those which result in a direct impact of three acres or less of waters of the state or 1 ,500 lin ear feet of streams (or a combination of the two is below the threshold) for which the applicant has incorporated best management practices and other provisions designed to safeguard water quality.  The Corps has received a completed  checklist and signed statement  fulfilling Tier I criteria for the project.  Accordingly, a request for             401 certification is not necessary and there will be no additional TCEQ review.   NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES   The staff archaeologist has reviewed the latest published version of the National Register of Historic Places, lists of properties determined eligible, and other sources of information.  The following is current knowledge of the presence or absence of historic prope rties and the effects of the undertaking upon these properties:   The permit area has been so extensively impacted by previous excavation of the ditch that there is no potential for historic properties to exist within the permit area.   Therefore, the propo sed project has no potential  to effect historic properties.  The permit area has been so extensively impacted by previous excavation of the ditch that there  is no potential for resources of concern to the Native American Tribes to exist within the permit a rea.  THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES:   Preliminary indications are that no known threatened and/or endangered species or their critical habitat will be affected by the proposed work.   PUBLIC INTEREST REVIEW FACTORS:   This application will be reviewed in accordance with 33 CFR 320 -332, the Regulatory Programs of the Corps , and other pertinent laws, regulations and executive orders.  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, of the proposed activity on the public interest.

The project can be located on the U.S.G.S. quadrangle map entitled:   Estes, Texas .    LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:   27.9722 North;  Longitude:   97.0899 West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION :  The applicant proposes to amend the footprint for a previously authorized project for a waterfront residential development as depicted on the attached plans (figures 1 ‐3).  The revised project would  eliminate the previously authorized access channel and residential canals and place clean fill material  within approxima tely 28 acres of the site.  Overall, the proposed fill area is composed of         19.11 acres of upland, 7.48 acres of salt marsh, and 1.41 acres of salt flats , which would require 13,665 cubic yards of fill in jurisdictional area .  No work has been initi ated at the project site at this time.   BACKGROUND:   The proposed project is an amendment to Permit SWG -2003 -01965 (formerly 23225), issued 27 July 2007, which authorized dredging to construct a canal subdivision and access channel to the Gulf Intracoastal  Waterway, maintenance dredging, docks, stabilization structures, and a mitigation area, and expired on                    31 December 2012.  The (01) amendment was issued on 28 December 2012 authorizing an extension of time without any changes and expire d 31 December 2018.   The (02) amendment was issued on 14 October 2021  and authoriz ed an extension of time to complete the project, eliminat ion of  the large boat basin, and chang ing the mitigation project protection from conservation easement to deed restriction .  AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by eliminating the access channel and residential canal s.  Aquatic resources have been avoided to the maximum extent practicable, the current project design would reduce impacts to Waters of the US by approximately 1.2 acres, no activity is proposed below the mean high ‐water line of the adjacent waterbody, and therefore, the amendment would remove all impacts to submerged aquatic vegetation.   Additionally, the permittee would complete permittee responsible mitigation consistent with the existing permit authorization including preserving in perpetu ity the on ‐site aquatic habitats that will not be impacted by this project.   MITIGATION:   The existing  mitigation plan would remain unchanged.  The plan provides  in‐kind creation of 6.48 acres of salt marsh on ‐site, and 2.55 acres created off ‐site.  In total, the applicant proposes to create 9.03 acres of salt marsh to compensate for the unavoidable impacts to this habitat.  The mitigation area will employ a  deed restriction to preserve 24.25 acres of salt marsh habitat in perpetuity.  The plan also provide s creat ion of 0.86 acre of salt flat habitat and preserv ation of  an additional 4.03 acres of salt flat habitat in perpetuity.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is located along the GIWW between Aransas Bay and Redfish Bay.  This area is bounded to the north by undeveloped land similar to the project site, to the east by the GIWW, to the west by State Highway 35 Business, and to the south by the P alm Harbor residential subdivision.  Redfish Bay and Aransas Bay offer shallow water habitat where seagrass beds and oyster reefs exist.  Water depths in the project area are approximately 6 feet and are devoid of either seagrasses or oyster reefs.  The bo ttom substrate of the project area is predominantly sand.  The bays provide habitat for numerous species of finfish, shellfish, shorebirds, wading birds, waterfowl and four species of sea turtles.  The area tidal flats and bay  waters also support populatio ns of waterfowl, wading birds, and shorebirds.  Waterfowl use the shallow vegetated bay areas and tidal flats for feeding and the deeper waters for resting.  The shallow waters within these bays also provide nursery and feeding grounds for numerous species  of fish and crustaceans important to sport and commercial fishing interests.  These include black drum, red drum, speckled trout, southern flounder, sheepshead, brown and white shrimp, and blue crab.  The project site occurs on the GIWW between Aransas an d Redfish Bay and consists of uplands interspersed with areas of: saltmarsh dominated by salt -flat grass, saltwort, glasswort, and sea ox -eye daisy; unvegetated sandflats; brackish marsh dominated by coastal dropseed and          sea ox -eye daisy; and a narrow band  of seagrasses immediately offshore.  A number of black mangroves are present along the GIWW shoreline .    NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.   This project information has not been verified by the Cor ps. The wetland delineation has been completed and was verified by the Corps on 23 June 2021 .  The applicant’s plans are enclosed in three  sheets.    A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.   Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA.

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  North Project Site:   Latitude:   28.731785  North;  Longitude:   -96.201372  West  South Project Site:   Latitude:  28.694422 North;  Longitude:  -96.235024 West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant proposes to install approximately                 6,620 linear feet of 20 -foot-wide breakwaters into open waters of Tres Palacios Bay for shoreline protection.   The applicant proposes to discharge approximately 13,515 cubic yards of clean rock fill to a height of 3 feet above the mean high  water line (MHWL) into approximately 1.68 acres of unvegetated open water for the northern breakwater  which would be comprise d of five individual segments.   The southern breakwater would require the discharge of approximately 8,850 cubic yards of clean rock fill to a height of 3 feet above the MHWL into approximately 1.34 acres of unvegetated open water  which would be comprised  of three individual segments .  The dimensions of each segment are located within the plans.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by orienting the design and location of the breakwater reefs to avoid impacts to waters of the U.S. as much as possible and designing the temporary workspace to be as close as possible to where the breakwater reefs will be constructed, yet still be located in unvegetated portions of the bay with no seagrass beds or oyster reefs, and being located as close as possible to the marina boat chan nel so barges and equipment have convenient, close access to the project site .  MITIGATION:   The applicant is not proposing mitigation since the project will serve to protect existing wetland habitat .  The applicant has stated that although approximately 1.36 acres of potential oyster habitat may be impacted by the proposed project, the breakwaters would create an additional 3.28 acres of oyster habitat resulti ng in a net gain of 1.72 acres of oyster habitat.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  is located in open water in Tres Palacios Bay which is highly developed and experiences heavy vessel traffic.  There are numerous structures such as piers, boat lifts, aids to navigation, boat ramps, etc.   Adjacent property use consists of residential, commercial, and undeveloped properties as well as marinas.

In addition, the applicant proposes to establish a dredged -and-marked 30 -foot-wide by 150-foot-long access channel into Port Bay from the existing boat canal. The proposed channelwould confine boat traffic to a single channel until reaching navigable depthsin Port Bay , thus minimizing possible seagrass and bay bottom damage by boat traffic where no channel currently exists.The proposed channel would have a 4 - by 185 -foot limestone breakwater (740-square -foot) installed on the southeast side to reduce wave energy and b ay bottom creep, and to minimize sedimentation and reduce the frequency of future maintenance dredging requirements. This feature would affect 0.01 acre of bay bottom. Four 8 -inch-diameter pilings would be installed at 37 -foot intervals along the edge of t he breakwater as markers to aid navigation.The new 0.11 -acre boat access channel would be dredged to a depth of -3.0 feet MSL. The calculated dredge material volume would be 292 CY of material. The dredged material would be mechanically excavated using aWilco amphibious excavator.The contractor unit is 16 -foot-wide and 32 -foot-long with two 5-foot-wide pontoons and weighs 58,000 pounds. The drive system is hydraulic, powered by the Caterpillar 330 Excavator engine and hydraulic system, and has pyram id or flotation shoes on the drive system.This excavator floats in -4.5 feet of water and has a 50 -foot operating reach.Dredging would start at the launch ramp basin and then proceed out the boat canal.Initially, the dredged material would be placed wit hin a ring of hay bales on the uplands adjacent to the boat basin for dewatering until the excavator is beyond reach of the shoreline. A backhoe onshore would transfer the dewatered material to a dump truck that would transport the material to one of two u pland disposal areas for unloading and leveling. Silt fenc ing would be utilized at the upland placement areas to hold the material in place until stabilized. When dredging beyond reach of the boat basin shoreline, and through the extent of the boat canal a nd proposed channel into Port Bay, the dredged materials would be placed on a set of small barges with sidewalls.When barge loading capacity is reached, the individual barges would be pushed by a small outboard motor to the launch ramp and offloaded by ba ckhoe into dump trucks.The dump trucks would relay the material to the upland disposal areas for unloading and leveling. Weighted sediment curtains would be used when working in open waters to minimize turbidity outside the work area. After the material has been placed within the upland disposal areas and one to two weeks of dryingtime has occurred, a small bulldozer w ould spread the material evenly within the disposal area.Based uponthe anticipated dredge volume, an approximately 1 -foot layer of mater ial w ould be spreadwithin each of thedisposal areas.Once settling and conditioning of the materials is achieved over several months, thedisposal areas wouldbe seeded with common bermudagrass to establish vegetative cover. The expected time to completedredging of the canal and associated access channel with breakwater is 22 days.

The applicant also proposes to install a 275 -foot-long by 8 -foot-wide (2,200 -square -foot) breakwater consisting of a double row of 36 -inch-diameter reef balls.   The reef ball s would be installed on a staggered offset with 3 feet of separation.  The expected time to complete installation of the reef ball breakwater is 3 days.   In addition, t he project would include launch ramp improvements through the addition of a 4- by-25-foot wing pier; a 4 - by-60-foot walkway, and three 3 - by-20-foot finger piers  within the canal .  An estimated 4,585 -square -foot of Widgeon grass ( Ruppia maritima ) would be directly impacted from the dredging and placement of the channel breakwater as currently proposed.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by the use of weighted sediment curtains during dredging operations to minimize turbidity outside the work area , and would use an upland contained disposal area for dewatering of dredged material.   MITIGATION:   Out of Kind – On-Site mitigation is offered to offset the seagrass impacts summarized above.   The construction of a breakwater using a double  row of                       36-inch-diameter reef balls  is proposed for the offset of impacts caused by the proposed mechanical dredging .  The reef balls w ould be installed on a staggered offset with 3  feet of separation.   This breakwater w ould dissipate wave energy from the prevailing  winds that impact this  impaired shoreline and slow or stop scouring of the nearshore water bottom.  The shadow effect of the breakwater  should allow for the expansion and/or establishment of submerged aquatic vegetation in t he shadow of  the breakwater with in the bare bay bottoms fronting the wetland shoreline, and bare bottoms within the  shallow waters behind the wetland shoreline.   This action is expected to restore water quality and aquatic function through the re -colonization of seagrasses within the wave  energy shadow.  The placement of the breakwater w ould be aligned where  areas of bare bay bottom interface with existing submerged aquatic vegetation.   An indirect effect of the  breakwater would be  to slow or stop the continuing loss of the emergent wetlands downwind of the structure and  potentially allow for some recovery.   The wave energy shadow behind the proposed breakwater covers approximately 5,000 -square -foot (0.11 acre) of bay bottom fronting  the wetland shoreline.     CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project is located along the southern shoreline of Cape Velero, a residential community situated along the eastern shore of Port Bay.  The existing canal is bordered by emergent estuarine wetlands domi nated by cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora ) in lower margin and sea ox -eye daisy ( Borrichia frutescens ) in the upper margin, with the canal itself containing no vegetation.  The community never established a dredged and marked channel from the boat canal int o Port Bay.   Boaters used an open pass through the emergent wetlands to access the bay  from the canal .  The width of this pass has expanded over time due to erosion of the bay front shoreline and loss of the emergent wetlands.   Under current conditions, boaters exiting the canal steer  in their direction of choice , which results in prop washing and damages t o the open bay bottom and seagrass beds between the opening of the canal and deeper water.   The project site for the proposed breakwater consists of heavily eroding bare shoreline formerly inhabited by estuarine wetlands with a vegetative cover similar to w hat is found along the shoreline of the existing canal.

The applicant stated that the purpose of the project is to maximize terminal and wharf efficien cy and optimize productivity at the Bayport Container Terminal by providing a fast turna round for container and cargo vessels to meet current cargo and supply chain demands.    BACKGROUND:  DA Permit 21520 was issued to the Port of Houston Authority (POHA) on 5 January 2004 after preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  Permitte d development for the Bayport Ship Channel (BSC) Container/Cruise Terminal included facilities for docking, loading, and unloading container ships and cruise ships, including container terminal and cruise terminal berths, a cruise ship turning basin, uplan d container storage areas, an intermodal yard, warehousing facilities, and properties available for light -industrial development.  The permit authorized dredging 127 acres of open water to construct a turning basin, berthing areas, and a transition area bet ween the project wharves and the BSC, and construction of an up to 200 -acre beneficial use (BU) site adjacent to Cell 14 of Atkinson Island.   Approximately 12 million CY of material was authorized to be dredged and placed in approved placement areas (PAs).   Approximately 19 acres of jurisdictional wetlands and 2 acres of open water and mudflats were authorized to be filled for construction of the terminal complex.  Compensatory mitigation  was required on the Memorial Tract and on a coastal prairie tract, and t here were agreements between the POHA and the resource agencies that the POHA would provide compensatory mitigation at the Banana Bend Tract.  The permit had a required construction completion date of 31 December 2009.   Nationwide Permit (NWP) 12 Verificati on No. SWG -05-12-031 was issued                               5 October 2005 to the P OHA for construction of underground pipelines within a Port Road right-of-way expansion.   The project was located in temporarily impacted wetlands immediately south of and parallel to Port Road.  NWP 14 Verification No.                         SWG -2005 -01003 was issued 26 February 2009 to the P OHA for the Port Road expansion project, impacting 0.165 acres of wetlands adjacent to Taylor Bayou along  Port Road.   The P OHA used 0.33 acres of created and restored wetlands at the     Memori al Tract to mitigate for the permanently impacted wetlands.   On 22 December 2009, the P OHA was issued an amendment to Permit No.                  SWG -1998 -01818 (formerly Permit 2 1520) authorizing an extension of the time limit for completion of construction to 31 December  2020, removal of the requirement to use turbidity curtains during hydraulic dredging (the requirement during mechanical dredging remains), removal of the requirement to monitor fugitive dust at the container terminal, consolidation of the container termin al pre -entry gate and main entry gate, and addition of PAs and BU sites where new work and maintenance dredged material from the         BSC Container/Cruise Terminal project, with the exception of new work material from the Cruise Terminal Turning Basin, can be p laced by hydraulic pipeline and mechanical means.  The approved additional PAs and BU  sites were  the existing Alexander Island PA, existing Spilmans Island PA, existing Atkinson Island Marsh BU  sites, three BU  sites authorized for the HSC Deepening and Wide ning Project but not yet constructed (Atkinson Island BUS Marsh Cells 7, 8, and 9), PA 14/15 Connection (also called Dredged Material Placement Area (DMPA) 14 and 15 Upland Expansion Area), and existing Midbay PA.   On 29 September 2014, another amendment to DA Permit SWG -1998 -01818 was issued to POHA and consisted of using hydraulic pipeline dredges to deepen all seven ship berths of the Bayport Ship Channel Container Terminal to -45 feet Mean Low Tide plus  2 feet of advance maintenance and 2 feet of allow able overdepth.   Approximately 1,231,000 cubic yards of new work dredged material, and future maintenance dredged material, from the berths would be placed in the following existing dredged material placement areas (PAs) and beneficial use of dredged materi al (BU) sites: PA 14, PA 15, PA 14/15 Connection, Mid Bay PA, P OHA's BSCCT lntermodal Yard/Upland PA 2, and Atkinson Island Marsh Cells M -5/6, M -7/8/9, and M -10.  Periodic maintenance dredging of the deepened berths would be performed for a 10 -year period w ith hydraulic pipeline dredges and/or mechanical dredges.  The time for completion for construction was           31 December 2020 and maintenance dredging was authorized until 31 December 2024.   On 25 July 2021, DA Permit SWG -1998 -01818 was further modified to  grant  an extension of time for maintenance dredging to previously authorized depths  for a period of 10 years and to authorize mechanical and/or hydraulic dredging of a 1.3 -acre extension to the west of the dock 7 b erth to a depth of -49-feet MLT (-50.5-feet MLLW); to remove                  20,000 cubic yards of dredged material from the 1.3 acres; to remove 5,000 cubic yards per annum of maintenance dredged material; and to place dredged material within designated PAs.   Various special conditions were removed and/ or replaced with this permit modification.   The time for completion of work under this amendment is                     31 December 2026.   DA Permit SWG -1998 -01818 was last modified on 21 December 2021 to add  the creation of a 402 -acre beneficial use site , Three Bird Island Ma rsh Complex (3 Bird Island) as a  PA.  The 3 Bird Island Marsh Complex consists of a marsh/bird island and an oyster wave trip complex.  The 3 Bird Island Ma rsh complex in the future will be filled with maintenance material from the surrounding navigation cha nnels to create marsh and island habitat for plants, fish, and birds.   The time for completion of work under this amendment is                 31 December 2026.

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:   30.008417 North;  Longitude:   095.254249 West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) -Houston District proposes channel maintenance on Outfall Ditch #13 between Farm -to-Market Road (FM) 1960 and East Townsen Boulevard  (Blvd.) (CSJ 1685 -03-107) that will result in approximately 3.825  acre of permanent impacts to the WET1 emergent  wetland as a result of excavation, grading, and placement of 21,600 cubic yards of fill (concrete  Flexamat  and native fill) throughout the channel and 1.406  acres of permanent impacts to IS1 intermittent  stream as a result of construction, grading, and placement of            3,600 cubic yards of fill (gabion  baskets and native fill).   The proposed project consists of the realignment,  recontouring, and armoring of approximately one mile of Outfall Ditch #13 and the replacement and  reconditioning of several culverts that drain adjacent properties.  The project proposes to recontour and armor  the channel with concrete          rip rap  to a 4 - to 6-foot width and a 2:1 side slope which would promote a more  efficient continuous drainage towards the listed intermittent stream (IS1).  The project would recontour and  stabilize the banks at a 3:1 slope with tied concrete control mats known as Flexamat.  The Flexamat would  provide the necessary stabilization to support high volume and velocity flows through the channel as well as to  allow herbaceous vegetation to re -establish through the mat.   In addition, gabion baskets will be placed along  both banks of IS1 and side slopes will be re contoured to a 3:1 side slopes.  Other activities include the  replacement of metal pipe culvert outfalls with reinforced concrete pipe culverts.  The existing box culvert at  Townsen Blvd . would remain in place.    AVOIDA NCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that the project impacts are limited to their established right of way (ROW) .  MITIGATION:   The applicant proposed to mitigate for the proposed wetland impacts via the purchase of mitigation credits from T arkington Bayou Mitigation Bank (TPMB)  to offset all unavoidable impacts to wetlands  at a 1:1 ratio .  Therefore, a total of 2.8 emergent HGMi credits, sold as a suite, would be purchased  from TBMB to compensate for unavoidable project impacts to wetlands .  For listed stream impacts, the applicant plans to purchase 2,295 stream credits from Houston Conroe Mitigation Bank (HCMB)  to satisfy stream mitigation  requirements for this project.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project area comprises a 3.825 -acre linear  emergent wetland (WET1) and a 1,908.7 -linear -foot intermittent stream (IS1).   WET1 and IS1 are hydrologically continuous features that were differentiated based on  presence/absence of an OHWM and bankfull  features.  The WET1 portion of the project area is located  west of Townsen Blvd. and was originally an upland area with some encroaching drainage features.  The current linear configuration of Outfall #13 was constructed in the late 1970s -early 1980s, likel y associated with the construction of         FM 1960.   The drainage ditch conveys drainage from FM 1960 and  downtown Humble north and east towards the IS1 stream channel east of Townsen Blvd. and eventually  into a former gravel pit with open water conditions.  The open water is part of a system of wetlands and  open waters that are adjacent to the West Fork of the San Jacinto River.

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:   29.307877° North;  Longitude:   094.822815° West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant propose s a modification to previously authorized Permit SWG -2012 -00602 to authorize the one -time use of the Federal Open Water Placement Area (PA) 50 for the placement of up to 200,000 -cubic -yards of maintenance material to be mechanically or hydraulically dredged from  approximately    33 acres at  the Texas International Terminals LTD (TXIT) Berths 2 & 3.  The purpose of the maintenance dredging is to prevent unsafe navigation conditions within the Berth due to high rates of siltation predicted to  occur due to the geomorphic position of the Berth.   PROJECT /PERMIT  HISTORY: A file history review revealed the original permit associated with this site was issued to Westport Galveston, Inc. in 1983 ( Permit # 16709).  This permit authorized the dredging o f an area and construction of mooring dolphins, walkways, bulkheads, and a dock for a ship and barge bulk handling terminal.   It had    four additional actions in the Corps database, some of which were withdrawals            16079 (1 -4).  The Corps tracking database has  permit numbers of SWG -1994 -00497,                         SWG -1997 -02241, SWG -1998 -00166 and SWG -1998 -01822 for the original permit modifications.  Permit # 21478 (SWG -1998 -02523) is also associated with this same location.  Permit 21478 was issued in 1999 to AIMCOR to perform mainte nance dredging for their operations at the site.   Permit amendment 21478(1) was an Extension of Time (EOT) issued 17 April 2003 , and expired 31 December 2013.   The EOT required the permittee to obtain an individual Section 401 water quality certification pri or to dredging and for the effluent or return water associated with the project.   Also, the EOT conditioned that the Disposal Area # 2 would need to be certified structurally sound by a state -licensed engineer.  In 2013, a name change was finalized from Galv eston Bulk Terminals to   Texas International Terminals.   SWG -2012 -00602 was issued on 20 March 201 4 and expired 13 December 2019 and authorized the permittee to construct two additional ship berthing facilities to be used for import and export of bulk cargo, oil , and petrochemical  products.  Work involves the construction of a 1,500 -foot by 109-foot dock supported by 1,837 24 -inch-square pre -cast concrete pilings.  The north and west sides of the dock would be reinforced with a       1,850 -linear -foot combi -wall breakwater.   A protective fender, braced with a                        12-inch-square concrete pile, would be located on the eastern dock face.   Four 48 -inch monopole protective mooring dolphins, lined with tires,  would be installed, two along the northern dredge project bounda ry and two immediately north of the existing dock.  An additional 220 -linear -feet of combi -wall would be constructed at the te rminal  end of the existing dry -bulk dock to the east of the proposed project.    Prior to initiating new fill activities, the riprap -lined bulkhead would be removed from the existing shoreline.  A new 539 -linear -foot combi -wall bulkhead and a 5 39-linear -foot riprap bulkhead would be installed with 110-cubic -yards of clean supportive sand backfill along the northern and western boundarie s of the fill area.   Approximately 100,000 -cubic -yards of clean fill material would be discharged behind that  bulkhead into 4.61  acres of unvegetated waters adjacent to the existing bay and Galveston Ship Channel to fill the area to 12.00 feet above  existin g grade.  An associated supportive sheet  pile tie -back wall would be installed shoreward of this fill, requiring an additional 1,000 -cubic -yards of     back fill, and matching the final grade of the new fill area to that of the existing shoreline.     To provide d eep-water access to the new berthing areas, a 10.37 -acre area located between the proposed ship loading facility and the existing  dock on the other side of the basin, would be dredged to a minimum depth of 40  feet below mean low tide (ML T) with a 2-foot o ver dredge,  and an ultimate depth of 45  feet below MLT with a 2 -foot over dredge when and if the depth within and adjacent to the channel is lowered  due to the Federal dredging project.  Approximately 293,842 -cubic -yards of material would be hydraulically dredged to facilitate the  minimum dredge depth.   An additional 36,730 -cubic -yards of material would be hydraulically dredged to facilitate the ultimate project depth.   Dredged material would be placed into two private existing upland dredged material  placement areas located at 4800 Port Industrial Road and at 5600 Port Industrial Road, in Galveston, Galveston County, Texas.   SWG -2020 -00602 was issued on 14 July 2020 and expires 31 December 2025 and authorized the permittee to modify and extend the exis ting permit (expired in        December 2019) increasing the previously authorized dredge  footprint from 18.22  acres to a total dredge area of 33  acres, and reduce the previously authorized fill placement of       101,110 -cubic -yards of fill within 4.61  acres of un -vegetated open water area to            4,700-cubic-yards  of sand fill material within 0.67  acre of un -vegetated open water habitat  below the mean high water (MHW) line.   As a result of the reduction of fill area, the permittee also proposes to entirely remove the formerl y approved 4.4 -acre proposed wetland mitigation project that was required as under the initial Permit                             (SWG -2012 -00602).   Construction work is  associated with the following:   • Construction of a ship berthing facility (Berth #2:  825-foot-long by 90 -foot-wide dry  bulk dock; Berth #3: 89 -foot-long by  40-foot-wide liquid cargo dock; pipe and access trestle:  1,374 -foot-long by 35 -foot-wide.   • Construction of a total of 1,441 -linear -feet (LF) of combi -wall structure:  852-LF to the south of the berth (of which 211 -LF will be  supported by grouted soil anchors or battered pile tiebacks  located parallel to the existing shoreline); 345 -LF to the west side entrance  of the berth; and 244 -LF to the east side entrance of the berth.   • Construction of 1,986 -LF of sheet pile wal l with a 3 -foot-wide concrete cap (serving as a break water) parallel to the Pelican Island  Causeway.   • Placement of three hundred 24 -inch-diameter pre -cast ground -driven concrete pilings and five hundred fifty 36 -inch-diameter  concrete (or steel) pre-cast ground -driven pilings to support Berths #2 and #3 .  • Placement of one hundred 36 -inch-diameter ground -driven steel (or concrete) piles for 10 berthing/mooring dolphins.   • Placement of two 60 -foot-diameter cell -structure turning dolphins.   • Dredging approximately 1.41 -million -cubic -yards of new cut materi al within the new dredge footprint to a minimum depth of  -45 feet mean lower low water (MLLW), with a    2-foot over dredge (additional 98,562 cy) .  • Utilization of federally authorized and constructed upland confined dredged material placement areas, includi ng the 5600, San Jacinto  and Pelican Island DMPA, as well as introducing the utilization of five Port of Galveston (POG) former ship slips (#12, #14, #37,  #39, and #41) and the POG PA to receive dredged materials from the construction phase of the project .  • Maintenance dredging of the approximately 33 -acre area for a period of 10 years .  On 11 May 2022 the permittee  submitted an application  to the Corps  with a request for authorization to maintenance dredge the existing TXIT Berth to maintain authorized depths of -45 feet mean lower low water (MLLW) with a 2 -foot over dredge and dispose of the dredged material in the Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site (ODMDS ) located approximately 3.7 -nautical -miles  offshore Galveston, Texas.  Based on sedimentation studies, TXIT estimates approximately 200,000 -cubic -yards of maintenance dredge material will be dredged annually.  TXIT plans to utilize hydraulic suction and mechanical dredging for the proposed maintenan ce dredge activities within the project area.   Other dredging methods considered for the project include hopper dredging.  Although not the preferred alternative at this time, hopper dredging is a dredging method that may be used in the future if deemed most  feasible by TXIT.   Hopper dredging would utilize a           hopper barge with an attached trailing drag head to dredge the material directly from the subsurface into the hopper barge.   The application was withdrawn on 30 November 202 2 for lack of applicant response to a request for additional information.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that sediment material sampling and analysis are proposed for the project to ensure the material would be  suitable for placement at PA 50 and confirm there are  no material sediment quality/contamination concerns.  Only temporary impacts including localized increases in turbidity are anticipated to occur as a result of the proposed dredging and material placement activities.   Industry standard best management pract ices (BMPs) will be utilized during dredging and placement activities to minimize temporary impacts to the maximum extent practicable and will be conducted in a manner consistent with the goals and policies of the Texas Coastal Management Program.   MITIGA TION:   The applicant is not proposing mitigation as the proposed activ ities are only associated with dredging activities and would  not cause impacts to any special aquatic sites .   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  consists of a ship loading/offloading facility and two ship berthing facilities surrounded by commercial /industrial  development s to the east, the Galveston Ship Channel to the north, Galveston Bay to the west, and a railway to the south.    NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s project plans  and Sampling and Analysis Plan for Sediment and Water Sample Collection, Testing, and Analysis for Maintenance Dredging are enclosed in 18 sheets.     A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary deter mination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Secti on 404 (b)(1) of the CWA .  OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     Consistency with the State of Texas Coastal Management Plan is required.

AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  This action is for an extension of time for a previously authorized permit.  No additional work is proposed to be done under this authorization.   MITIGATION:   As compensatory mitigation for impacts to jurisdictional areas, the property owner established a deed restriction on 7 April 2008 to protect in perpetuity   three preservation areas:  Conservation Area A (28.26 acres), Conservation Area B (71.95 acres) and Conservation area C (2.8 acres of preserved habitat and 6.31 acres of created habitat).     CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site c onditions consist primarily of relict pasture that contain s uplands within the current project work area.  Outside of the project boundary, these areas slope  lower into saltwater coastal flat wetlands that include expansive mudflats, intermixed with intert idal emergent wetlands dominated by cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora ) and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans ) in the lowe r elevations .   DA Permit 23357 was issued on 12 December 2007 and authorized construction of a resort complex for residential  housing, retail establishments, channels, and a marina to be sited within an existing 37 ‐acre tidal basin.  An amendment  renumbered as             SWG‐2001‐02279 was issued on 22 May 2008 and transferred the original permit to       PA Waterfront, L.P.  and reduce d the project area from the original 835 acres to 435 acres.  A second amendment was issued on 18  November 2010 and authorized additional changes to the permitted layout for the marina.  These included the additional  excavation of 10.77 acres of upland, whil e not excavating 8.76 acres of upland previously permitted to be excavated.   The amendment also authorized construction of a 75 ‐foot by 36 ‐foot boat ramp and floating boat slips for 68 vessels  and extended the permit’s expiration date to                        31 December 2015.  A third amendment, issued on 29 June 2016,  authorized an extension of time to 31 December 2021.     Construction of the facility is still ongoing and was not completed within the previously authorized construction time  window.   A jurisdictional determination co mpleted                    21 November 2022 indicates that no new wetlands have developed  within the unexcavated portion of the previously permitted canal network since the previous amendment issued in  2016.  The applicant is making no changes to the design of the project and would  continue to construct the project  according to the previously permitted plans.  No other changes to the original permit have been requested.   NOTES:   This public notice is being  issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.  The wetland delineation has been completed and was verified by the Corps on 21 November 2022 .

The methods are rapid  assessment tool s to help distinguish between ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial streamflow at the reach scale for the Northeast and Southeast SDAM Regions. The beta SDAM s may help provide technical guidance for identifying waters that may be subject to regulatory jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act ; however , these methods do not alter or change the definition of “ Waters of the U.S. ”   These beta SDAM s were developed for use in all or part of the s tates of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri , Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas , and the District of Columbia  by the Corps and  EPA (Figure 1). Due to differences in climate and a relatively small amount of data points, the Caribbean sites were not used to develop this iteration of the SDAM , nor is the Caribbean covered by the methods. Th ese beta methods result from a literature review and multi-year field study conducted at 336 stream reaches across the range of hydrologic landscapes of the Northeast and Southeast. Developed through statistical analyses  of the field data, the beta SDAMs  provide a data -driven approach using reliable indicators to determine  streamflow duration class at the reach scale. The agencies are making these beta SDAM s available for a one year preli minary implementation and comment period to inform the development of final SDAM s for the Northeast and Southeast .    The beta SDAM s for the Northeast and Southeast can be applied  whenever there is uncertainty regarding streamflow duration class  and a rapid evaluation method is desired . The methods provide a scientifically supported, rapid assessment framework to support best professional judgment in a consistent, robust, repeatable, and defensible way. Use of the methods may  result in timelier and more predictable jurisdictional determinations and are also useful where knowledge of streamflow duration class improves ecological assessment, management, and decision-making. The beta S DAM s were developed specifically from data collected in the Northeast and Southeast.   The methods, data forms , and training opportunities are available on the internet at:  https://www.epa.gov/streamflow-duration- as sessment/beta- streamflow -duration- assessment -method -northeast- and-southeast .   Practitioners such as stream ecologists, aquatic ecologists, hydrologists, and wetland scientists are encouraged to comment on their experience using the beta SDAM s. Comments regarding the following specific topics would be especially useful:   • Problem situations encountered and possible approaches for addressing them. • Seemingly  incorrect r esults, including the factors that suggest the method was in accurate. • Indicators that were particularly useful or not useful in identifying flow duration in different hydrological environments. • Regional differences in the applicability of specific indicato rs. • Potential uses of the methods in the regulatory context, or in other watershed planning or management contexts.

The total overwater square footage of the project would be 45,260- square- foot consisting of:   a      90-foot-long by 25- foot-wide deck for a bait shop, public bathrooms and access control on the south side of the pier close to the land; a 1,030.7- foot-long (from MHW) by             20-foot-wide walkway, and a 70.5- foot-long diamond- shaped terminal platform that would extend 69.5 feet on each side of the 20- foot walkway area (159 feet at its widest).  The proposed pier structure would be constructed of driven concrete piles at the landside concession and public area and steel pipe piling for the stem and diamond head with the total number consisting of 44 (24- inch-square), 62 (24- inch-square), and 22 (48- inch-square) piles.  Construction cranes and material would arrive and be supported on barges.  A temporary trestle may be constructed with driven steel piles and a temporary deck adjacent to the new pier for construction of the new pier  and demolished prior to completion of the project.  No dredging or fill is involved.  There are no seagrasses or wetlands at the project location.  The purpose of the project is to provide public accessibility and recreational opportunities to the general public.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION:   The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized the environmental impacts by rebuilding the pier within the footprint of the existing pier that will be removed.   MITIGATION:   No mitigation is proposed.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is currently a beachfront tract on the GOM  that has been developed for public recreational use.  A paved parking area and pavilion is located on the landward side of the beach dune ridge, as well as an RV park.  The dune ridge  is part of a belt of dunes 15-  to 20- foot-wide on average, and up to            35-foot high that runs along the GOM side of the island.  The vegetation stabilizing the dunes consists of drought resistant species such as sea oats, beach panic grass, and beach morning glory.  The beach animal community is dominated by rodents such as pocket gophers, kangaroo rats, spotted ground squirrels, grasshop per mice, rice rats and cotton rats.  An estimated 600 species of saltwater fish inhabit the coastal waters of the GOM.  Sea turtles frequent the GOM  nearshore area  and utilize the beach area for nesting.  Large numbers of waterfowl and shorebirds are common along the beach area, most of which are migratory .  Sargassum often washes up on the GOM beaches in large concentrations that contain numerous invertebrates, including small shrimp, crabs and amphipods.   These entrapped organisms prov ide forage opportunities for shorebirds.   The lower beach zone where sargassum washes ashore can also be populated with amphipods, polychaetes, and small bivalves, such as coquina clams.  Typically, moderate to large sargassum concentrations begin to wash up on the beaches in early spring and persist through early summer.  Terrestrial foragers of washed- up sargassum include coyotes, terrestrial crabs, beetles and flies.   Sargassum can act as a natural fertilizer to dune vegetation and also trap wind- blown s and, both of which serve to stabilize the beach/dune environment.

The dredged material was placed in placement areas 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, or beneficial use areas.  This permit was set to expire on 31 December 2020.   DA Permit SWG -2014 -00315 was issued on 20 March 2015 and authorized the removal of an existing bulkhead and marine structures, performance of mechanical and hydraulic dredging of 55,000 cubic yards of material (to a depth of -15 MLT), construction of           900 linear feet of sheet pile bulkhead, install 11 new monopole breasting dolphins, construct a new access road, parking area, foundations for onshore equipment, and relocate 2 existing drainage outfalls.  Dredged material could be placed into placeme nt areas 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, or the Nelda Stark Unit of the Lower Neches Wildlife Management Area.   DA Permit 12269 was issued on 30 November 1977 and authorized the dredging of        two ship berthing areas and one entrance channel.   This authorizat ion expired on              31 December 1980.   DA Permit 12269 was amended on 27 December 1990 to extend maintenance dredging for 10 years.  This authorization expired on 31 December 2000.   DA Permit SWG -2007 -00259 (formerly DA 12269) was authorized on 1 8 June 2007 and authorized maintenance dredging for 10 years.  This authorization expired on                       31 December 2012.   On 21 November 2019, the Corps completed a consolidation request for all previously authorized permits, work, and structur es within the Nederland Terminal property under DA Permit SWG -2007 -01401.  As a component of this consolidation, the applicant requested authorization to maintenance dredge for 10 years, modify existing structures, and to fill 0.636 acres of PFO and 199 li near feet of perennial stream in order to construct a Butane Chiller Facility.     DA Permit SWG -2007 -01401 was amended on 27 May 2021 and authorized the temporary discharge of fill into 8.75 acres of palustrine emergent wetlands (PEM),         0.66 acre of palustrine scrub -shrub wetlands (PSS), 3.95 acres of palustrine forested wetlands (PFO) and permanent  discharge of  fill into 10.57 acres of PEM, 0.31 acres of PSS, 119.27 acres of PFO, and 295 linear feet (0.10 acre) of stream.  This amendment also authori zed the conversion of 0.66 acres of PSS to PEM and 3.95 acres of PFO to PEM and dredging of 5.87 acres (1,082 linear feet) of the Neches River.   The permittee was authorized  to permanently impact 0.09 acres of stream by placing two 48 -inch culverts in orde r to construct a petrochemical facility expansion and 0.01 acre of stream to stabilize the banks for access road improvements.   This amendment further authorized the permittee to raise the grade, by filling, an adjacent 132.6 -acre area to an elevation of +9 feet MLLW using excavated material and/or  clean imported fill.  This 132.6 -acre area consists of the North Development Area (69.3 acres) and Mid Development Area         (63.3 acres) and  would house new liquefied petroleum gas processing units, approximately 4 refrigerated liquified petroleum gas storage tanks, 9 aboveground  storage tanks, and a new pump manifold.   The permittee was also authorized to modify the existing Dock C to accommodate Aframax sized vessels and meet Sabine Pilot’s association safety standards.   As a component of this dock modification, the permittee w ould remove nine breasting dolphins, the Dock C platform, two firewater pump foundations  and associated firewater equipment, firewater intake support piles, the approachway, the dock house, a section of bulkhead, and product piping.   Following removal, the permittee  would  dredge 330,000 cubic yards of material within a 5.87 -acre area of the Neches River to a depth of  -43.9 feet Mea n High Water [MHW; -43.0 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW)] +/ - 2 feet.  An additional         0.43 acre w ould be excavated in  uplands for a total area of 6.3 acres for future maintenance dredging.  The dredged material w ould be placed onsite or within  Placement Areas  18, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25.  The permittee w ould then construct a 135 - by 80-foot pile supported platform, a gangway tower, a hose tower with  hydraulic crane,          4 product loading arms, 4 ship breasting dolphins with walkways, 5 onshore m ooring dolphins, an onshore valve containment  foundation, firewater intake structure and equipment, dock house, pipe rack, product piping, and install approximately                   1,160 linear feet of  sheet pile bulkhead.  The permittee w ould also condu ct 10 years of maintenance dredging.  The permittee was authorized to place all  maintenance dredged material, to include associated effluent discharge, from Dock C dredge area as well as all previously authorized  maintenance dredge areas (A -B Barge Dock, D ock 1, Dock 2,   Dock 3, Dock 4, Dock 5, Dock 6, Layberth A, and Layberth D) onsite within the  new development areas or within Placement Areas  (PA) 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25.     AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by configuring the facility to the smallest footprint necessary to meet the project’s purpose and need, while maintaining safety.  New infrastructure for material offloading (MOF Dock) will allow for efficien t design of the facility and help to minimize the overall construction footprint by utilizing offsite construction where processing units will be constructed in modules and transported to the project site via marine vessels.  This construction method reduc es impacts by removing the need for the larger construction footprint that would be necessary to construct and assemble the modules onsite.   A detailed analysis of onsite and offsite alternatives were considered for the siting of the project  and was provid ed to the Corps for evaluation .        Fill material utilized for the project will be sourced from the excavation of Corps PA 23, excavation/dredge material generated by the new Dock 7 and MOF Dock construction, dredge material generated by the Dock C modi fications, and other local providers of crushed limestone, imported earthen fill, and stone/rock fill.  In order to minimize impacts associated with the placement of dredge material onsite, the applicant stated they will sample the dredge material excavate d for the Dock 7, MOF Dock and Dock C activities to identify potential contaminants in accordance with federal standards prior to placement.  The applicant is not proposing to sample the dredge material excavated from                Corps PA 23 because all  material disposed of in federal placement areas was done so in accordance with the Texas dredging and dredged material disposal and placement policy (31 TAC §501.25).   During construction, best management practices (BMPs) will be utilized to assist in the  control of erosion and minimize the transport of sediments.       BMPs may include the use of silt fences, straw bales, and other measures as appropriate to minimize erosion and sedimentation during construction.  The applicant stated they designed the project to minimize the amount of additional workspace needed for construction staging and equipment storage by utilizing the proposed permanent footprint for these activities to the extent practicable.  In addition, the applicant has designed the project to minimize the footprint by utilizing the permanent workspace for the positioning, laydown yards, access, etc .  MITIGATION:   As part o f the previous authorization issued on 27 May 2021, the applicant was required to purchase 71.043 forested Temporary Storage and Detention of Storage Water (TSSW) Functional Credit Units (FCUs), 63.753 forested Maintain Plant and Animal Communities (MPAC) FCUs, 73.480 forested Removal and Sequestration of Elements and Compounds (RSEC) F CUs, 8.993 palustrine scrub -shrub/emergent TSSW FCUs, 6.539 palustrine scrub -shrub/emergent MPAC FCUs,  6.739 palustrine scrub -shrub/emergent RSEC FCUs, from the Graham Creek Mitigation Bank and/or Pineywoods Mitigation Bank.   The applicant propose s to miti gate for the expanded project footprint impacts by purchasing an additional 8.827 physical FCUs, 37.160 biological FCUs, and               52.369 chemical FCUs for PFO wetland impacts, 17.329 physical FCUs, 16.317 biological FCUs, and 16.629 chemical FCUs for PSS wetland impacts, and 168.491 physical FCUs, 112.348 biological FCUs, and 134.669 chemical FCUs for PEM impacts  from the Pineywoods Mitigation Bank .    CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is currently within the Neches River and an undeveloped tract of land adjacent to the applicant’s Nederland Terminal facility.   The surrounding area is heavily developed with other commercial and industrial facilities.   The tract consists of wetland forest, open marsh, the Neches River, maintained t ransportation right of ways, utility right of ways, and industrial development.   Within the utility rights of way, typical vegetative species include smut grass ( Sporobolus indicus ), Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon ), and yellow bluestem ( Bothriochloa ischa emum ).  Typical plants within the forested wetlands include Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera ), red maple       (Acer rubrum ), and red mulberry ( Morus rubra ).  Typical plants within scrub -shrub wetlands include Chinese tallow, black willow  (Salix nigra ), and alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxeroides).  Lastly, representative vegetation within emergent wetlands includes common reed ( Phragmites australis ), torpedo grass ( Panicum repens ), and alligatorweed.

Soupier   Telephone :  713-381-6757   Email:  mpsouliere@eprod.com   LOCATION:   The project site is located  in Freeport Harbor Ship Channel and the Gulf of Mexico , at 151517 Old Quintana R oad, in Freeport, Brazoria County, Texas 77541 .  The project can be located on the U.S.G.S. quadrangle map entitled:  Freeport , Texas.    LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:   28.938821  North;  Longitude:   -95.318136  West   PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   Seaway is requesting  a modification to their existing Department of the Army Permit  to conduct new work dredging of approximately                     1 million cubic yards (MCY) of material within Se away’s existing 33 -acre basin to lower the depth to -59 feet mean lower low water (MLLW).   Post d redge -event, Seaway is proposing the installation of 5,200 cubic yards of revetment along 2,440 linear feet of existing sheet pile.  Material dredged from the basin is proposed for disposal in the Freeport New Work Offshore Dredge Material Disposal Site (OD MDS).  Seaway also proposes to perform intermittent silt  blade dredging  to maintain dredge prism .       FREEPORT ODMDS:   The Freeport Harbor New Work ODMDS is located approximately 6 miles offshore, with its area bounded by the following coordinates:   28°50'51” N, 95""13'54""W; 28""51'44""N, 95""14'49”W;  28""50'15”N, 95°16'40""W; 28""49'22""N, 95""15'45""W   The site occupies an area of approximately 2.64 nautical square miles (3 .49 square statute miles), with depths ranging from 54 to 63 feet.  Baseline conditions at the    Freeport New Work ODMDSs were assessed during the site designation process.   Details of ba seline conditions, including descriptions of the marine environment in the site vicinity and the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the sediments and the water column at the site, are contained in the Final Environmental Impact Statement  (EIS), Freeport Harbor 45 -Foot Project (45 -foot Project), Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site Designation prepared by EPA, Region 6, in January 1990.   Since it’s designation in 1990, the site has been used for four dredge event s with a total of 6,015,690  MCY of dredge material disposed.  The most recent disposal event was in 2015 when 1,985,260 MCY were placed.   AUTHORIZED DISPOSAL EFFECTS:   Dredged material deposited at the Freeport ODMDS disperse and erode quickly.  There are no significant environmental resources delineated within or immediately outside of the designated ODMDS.   Since this site is dispersive in nature, the primary concern of the use of the site is the potential short -term buildup of dredged material, such that a hazard to navigation is pre sented.   Another concern is whether there is significant short -term transport of the dredged material beyond the ODMDSs boundaries; specifically, the benthic community can be impacted if significant rapid movement of material off the site occurs, resulting in burial of benthic populations outside the site.   CHARACTERISTICS AND COMPOSITION OF THE DREDGED MATERIAL:   Core borings were collected in 2019 and tested for grain size characteristics.  Sediment samples were determined to be mostly silty clays with very little sand from the sediment surface to a depth of approximately -59 ft MLLW in the facility.    Sediment, water, and elutriate sampling were conducted adjacent to the facility in 2021 to support the federal project to deepen and widen the federal channel  in Freeport, Texas.  Samples were collected from 19 substations and composited into 6 sediment samples,   1 to represent each DMMU (FP2 -1, FP2 -2, FP2 -3, FP4, FP1 -1, FP1 -2).  Six elutriate sample s were also collected to represent each of the DMMUs.  All sediment samples underwent chemical, physical, and toxicological/biological analysis.  The material proposed for disposal from the federal project was determined to comply with the ocean disposal requirements of 40 CFR 227.     While dredged material has be en tested in the Freeport Harbor Inner Channel and Basin, new testing at the Seaway Facility is required because material from the dock footprint itself has never been tested for its suitability for ocean disposal.  A Sampling Analyses Plan (SAP)/Quality As surance Project Plan (QAPP) will be approved by the Corps and EPA to analyze the material within the Seaway Facility and determine its suitability for offshore placement.   This analysis will consist of all three analytical tiers (Tier I, Tier II, and Tier I II) .  AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by conducting an alternatives analysis of the potential  material disposal options to determine the most practicable and feasible alternative for the placement of the dredged material.   Based on the results of their analysis , Seaway  concluded that the ODMDS had the least environmental impact.   MITIGATION:   The ap plicant has not proposed to mitigate for the proposed impacts .  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  Historically, the Seaway Basin and surrounding land uses included commercial, residential, open land, and open water.   Cattle grazing was the predominant land use within open land prior to the construction of the Seaway infrastructure.   Currently, the Seaway Basin serves as an open water basin which allow vessel access to Seaway docks for loading and offloading of bulk products.  As this site has already been heavily disturbed and has required numerous permits, consultation with the SHPO will have already been completed prior to authorization .  NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not bee n verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 11 sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary d etermination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to S ection 404 (b)(1) of the CWA .  OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     The applicant has stated that the project is consistent with the Texas Coastal Management Program (CMP) goals and policies and will be conducted in a manner consistent with said Program.  The Texas Railroad Commission will determine if the project is consi stent with the goals and policies of the CMP and will review this application under Section 401 of the CWA to determine if the work would comply with State water quality standards .    The proposed project will trigger review under Section 401 of the Clean Wa ter Act (CWA).  The Texas Railroad Commission will review this application under Section 401 of the CWA and in accordance with Title 30, Texas Administrative Code Section 279.1 -13 to determine if the work would comply with State water quality standards.

This is a requirement for activities that seek permission, to temporarily or permanently, alter, o ccupy, or use a federally authorized United States Army Corps of Engineers civil works project.  Changes to the proposed project, from the Section 408 process, may warrant additional coordination.   NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES:   The staff archaeologist has  reviewed the latest published version of the National Register of Historic Places, lists of properties determined eligible, and other sources of information.  The following is current knowledge of the presence or absence of historic properties and  the effects of the undertaking upon these properties:    The permit area has been so extensively impacted by previous dredging  and placement of dredged material (in the ODMDS) that there is no potential for historic  prope rties to exist within the permit areas.  Therefore, the proposed project has no potential  to effect historic properties.   THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES:   Threatened and/or endangered species or their critical habitat may be affected by the proposed work.   Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and/or the National Marine Fisheries Service will be initiated to assess the effect on endangered species.

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:  27.5817 North;  Longitude:  97.2183 West   PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant proposes to construct a new public pier in the general footprint of an existing one damaged by Hurricane Harvey.  The existing pier will be demolished under the conditions of its construction permit (No. 14690).   A  raised walkway would extend from the paved parking lot, over the dunes, and to the pier.  The new pier will include a 20- foot-wide walkway from the beach, a hexagonal intermediate area (116 feet long by  55 feet wide overall), and a terminal hexagonal area (159 feet long by 70.5 feet wide overall).  There will also be a concession area, a public plaza area, public bathrooms, bait shop, and access control at the landside end that would cover approximately 17,387.5 feet over the GOM. The pier will extend a total of 1,141 feet from the Mean High Water (MHW) line out into the GOM.  The walkway will be 20 feet wide except at the intermediate hexagonal area and extend 1,070.5 feet from the MHW line to the terminal hexagonal structure.  Total square footage of the project is 40,300 square feet.  The pier would  be supported by driven concrete or steel pilings. No dredging or fill is involved.  Construction cranes and materials would likely be transported to the sit e and supported on barges. A temporary trestle may be erected with driven steel piles and a temporary deck adjacent to the new pier  for use during construction activities and would be demolished prior to completion of the project.  There are no seagrasses or wetlands at the project location.  The purpose of the project is to provide public accessibility and recreational opportunities to the general public.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION:  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized the environmental impacts by rebuilding the pier within the footprint of the existing pier that will be removed.   MITIGATION:  No mitigation is proposed.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is currently a beachfront tract on the GOM  that has been developed for public recreational use. A paved parking area and pavilion is located on the landward side of the beach dune ridge, as well as an RV park.  The dune ridge is part of a belt of dunes 15 to 20 feet wide on average, and up to 35 feet high that runs along the GOM side of the island.  The vegetation stabilizing the dunes consists of drought resistant species such as sea oats, beach panic grass, and beach morning glory. The beach animal community is dominated by rodents such as pocket  gophers, kangaroo rats, spotted ground squirrels, grasshopper mice, rice rats and cotton rats. An estimated 600 species of saltwater fish inhabit the coastal waters of the GOM.  Sea turtles frequent the GOM  nearshore area and utilize the beach area for nesting. Large numbers of waterfowl and shorebirds are common along the beach area, most of which are migratory . Sargassum often washes up on the GOM beaches in large concentrations that contain numerous invertebrates, including small shrimp, crabs and amphi pods. These entrapped organisms provide forage opportunities for shorebirds. The lower beach zone where sargassum washes ashore can also be populated with amphipods, polychaetes, and small bivalves, such as coquina clams. Typically, moderate to large sargassum concentrations begin to wash up on the beaches in early spring and persist through early summer. Terrestrial foragers of washed- up sargassum include coyotes, terrestrial crabs, beetles and flies. Sargassum can act as a natural fertilizer to dune veget ation and also trap wind- blown sand, both of which serve to stabilize the beach/dune environment.

BACKGROUND/","MINIMIZATION :The applicant(Entergy Texas, Inc ./Entergy) has stated that they have avoided and minimizedthe environmental impact s to the maximum extent practicable .The applicant stated that impacts were minimized through preferred substation selection. Implementation of best management practices (BMPs) during construction will reduce noise, dust e missions, and erosion, as well as minimize adverse effects to the human and natural environment. The proposed access road and substation footprint has been minimized to the fullest extent practicable in order to reduce impacts to PFO wetlands. Additionally , the proposed substation was placed adjacent to an existing transmission line ROW to reduce fragmentation of existing forested habitat. No secondary impacts to downstream flows, hydrology, or water quality are anticipated as a result of the proposed proje ct.The applicant will prepare a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and obtain a Notice of Intent for stormwater discharges from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).The SWPP Plan will identify potential sources of pollution, wh ich may reasonably be expected to affect the quality of storm water runoff from construction of the site.The plan will describe the implementation of BMPs, which will be used to reduce the pollutants in storm water runoff associated with construction acti vities at the construction site. MITIGATION: The applicantis proposing to secure credits from an approved mitigation bank, which requires review of components baseline information and determination of credits.Additionally, Entergy utilized the mitigati on rule hierarchy to research potential compensatory mitigation sites within the East Fork San Jacinto River HUC.Based on RIBITS, mitigation bank credits (third party mitigation) are available for in -kind within the East Fork San Jacinto River HUC watersh ed.Riverine forested biological, chemical, and physical credits are available within the primary watershed. Approximately 0.134 acres of palustrine forested (PFO) wetlands will be converted to an emergent wetland type, and approximately 1.63 acres of PFO wetlands and 0.004 acres of palustrine emergent (PEM) wetlands will have a permanent loss of wetland functions due deposition of fill material and excavation during construction of the substation, detention pond, access road, and for pole installation at t he preferred option location.Conversion impacts to PFO wetlands will result from clearing and grubbing activities within 25 -foot of the substation for storm resilience.The temporary impacts to other waters from access road culvert installation and clearin g and grubbing activities will equate to 0.03 acres. Loss of functions to other waters are not anticipated from culvert installation.The temporary workspace within the existing transmission line cut -in will impact 0.23 acres of PEM wetlands and will be returned to pre -construction contours and restored by natural revegetation upon completion of construction activities.The restored area will be monitored during construction and restoration will be documented to determine success of natural re -vegetation (i .e., regrowth of previously existing grasses and shrubs based on the existing seed source at the site). With respect to the term “natural restoration” and criteria to judge that this condition has been reached, the applicant is confident that regrowth of p reviously existing grasses and shrubs is highly likely based on the existing seed source at the site.If the restored area does not have 70% aerial coverage of vegetation, the applicant will coordinate with theUnited State Army Corps of Engineers(USACE ) on replanting with native grasses. The applicant has partially completed the previously USACE authorized mitigation plan on 23 January 2023. Entergy completed a mitigation bank credit purchase with a 1.0 credit multiplier to offset losses based on the f ollowing:• PFO Wetlands:TSSW (Physical) – 0.8 functional capacity units (FCU’s), MPAC (Biological) – 1.4 FCU’s, RSEC (Chemical) – 0.9 FCU’s.• PEM Wetlands TSSW (Phy) – 0.1 FCU’s, MPAC (Bio) – 0.1 FCU’s, RSEC (Chem) – 0.1 FCU’s. Entergy executed an agreement and pur chased 1.4 TSSW, 1.4 MPAC, and 1.4 RSEC FCUs from the Tarkington Bayou Mitigation Bank (TBMB) to satisfy mitigation measures which includes loss and conversion of PFO wetland functions from placement of the substation, detention pond, and access road. Entergy is currently in the process of completing the USACE approved mitigation credit purchase for 0.1 TSSW, 0.1 MPAC, and 0.1 RSEC FCUs from TBMB for emergent wetland credits from the TBMB to offset the impacts to emergent wetlands on the project site. The mitigation plan for the newly proposed project modifications would be to complete a mitigation bank credit purchase with a 1.0 credit multiplier to offset the losses based on the following:• PFO Wetlands: TSSW (Phy) – 0.7 FCU’s, MPAC (Bio) – 1.2 FCU’s, R SEC (Chem) – 0.8 FCU’s.• PEM Wetlands TSSW (Phy) – 0.1 FCU’s, MPAC (Bio) – 0.1 FCU’s, RSEC (Chem) – 0.1 FCU’s. The proposed project modifications would reduce the total proposed physical, biological, and chemical FCUs, to compensate the impacts to PFO wet land functions, to 1.2 TSSW, 1.2 MPAC, and 1.2 RSEC FCUs from the TBMB, which is 0.6 FCU’s less than the previously USACE authorized mitigation plan.The proposed mitigation credit purchase to compensate for the impacts to emergent wetlands would remain asoriginally approved.","['Liberty County', None]",,"['Cleveland', ""ERROR: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'""]",,['95.1325'],['30.3291'],,,"[('0.19', '0.23 acres.• Total loss  wetland', None), ('1.63', '.• Conversion impacts in PFO wetland', None)]",[],"    Public Notice   U.S. Army Corps  Permit Application No:   SWG -2022 -00346 Of Engineers  Date Issued:   23 February 2023  Galveston  District  Comments Due:   27 March 2023      U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, GALVESTON DISTRICT    PURPOSE OF PUBLIC NOTICE:   To inform you of a proposal for work in which you might be interested.

The proposed mitigation credit purchase to compensate for the impacts to emergent wetlands would remain as  originally approved.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is located in Liberty County, Texas, southwest of the intersection of State Highway (SH) 105 W and SH 105.  The surrounding areas primarily consist of undeveloped bottomland hardwood forests broken by pastures, scrub/shrub habitats and cleared ROWs along existing roadways and distribution lines.  The project site is primarily forested with a section of maintained herbaceous ROW along the southern boundary .  Palustrine forested wetland habitats were dominated by Loblolly pine ( Pinus ta eda),     Red maple ( Acer rubrum ), Water oak ( Quercus nigra ), Sweet bay magnolia           (Magnolia virginiana ), Sweet gum ( Liquidambar styraciflua ), Dwarf palmetto                (Sabal minor ), Possumhaw (Ilex decidua ), Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera ), Wax myrtle (Morella cerifera ), Redtop panicgrass ( Coleataenia rigidula ), Swamp sunflower (Helianthus angustifolius ), Climbing dogbane ( Thyrsanthella difformis ),                       Evening trumpetflower  (Gelsemium sempervirens ), Heller’s rosette grass    (Dichanthelium oligosanthes ), American holly ( Ilex opaca ), Winged elm ( Ulmus alata ), Eastern baccharis ( halimifolia ), and Little bluestem ( Schizahyrium scoparium ).  Palustrine emergent wetland habitats were dominated by Dwarf palmetto ( Sabal minor ), Redtop panicum ( Coleataenia rigidula ), Swamp sawgrass ( Cladium mariscus ),             Blunt spikerush ( Eleocharis cobtusa ), Needle leaf witch grass ( Dicanthelium aciculare ), Heller’s rosette grass ( Dichanthelium oligosanthes ), Yellow nutsedge                        (Cyperus esculentus ), Deeprooted sedge ( Cyperus entrerianus ), Eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia ), Bermuda grass ( Cynodon dactylon ), and Southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis ).    The to pography within the project site can be described as gently sloping from north to south with slopes of 0 to 4%.  Overall waterflow trajectory within the site is from north to south.  Each mapped wetland feature appears to have connectivity with the mapped other water features, which appear to continue south and terminating into other waterways to the south.  According to the Liberty County Soil Survey, the project site has three mapped soil units.  The soil units located within the project area are:  HatA -Hatliff-Pluck -Kian complex, 0 -1% slopes, frequently flooded, SosA -Sorter -tarkington complex, 0 -1% slopes, and WetA -Westcott -plumgrove complex, 0 -1% slopes.

The entire site contains 11.83 acres of wetlands subject to the Corps regulatory authority.   A completed    Approved Jurisdictional Determi nation found that 30.61  acres of wetlands on the northern portion of the subject tract are non -jurisdictional and therefore not subject to the Corps jurisdictional authority.   This AJD was coordinated with the EPA as may be viewed at https://www.swg.usace.army.mil/Portals/26/SWG201900234.pdf .       NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verifi ed by the Corps.  The wetland delineation has been completed and was verified by the Corps on 13 January 2023 .  The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 21 sheets.     A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this         preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluatio n will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA .    OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:   The project site is not located within the       Texas Coastal Zone and therefore,  does not require certification from the Texas Coastal Management Program.   The proposed project will trigger review under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) will review this application under Se ction 401 of the CWA and in accordance with Title 30, Texas Administrative Code Section 279.1 -13 to determine if the work would comply with State water quality standards .

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:  30.646086° North;  Longitude:  -93.885575° West   PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The sponsor  proposes the establishment and operation of a 65-acre mitigation bank named the Call Junction Mitigation Bank. The sponsor ’s plan is to restore and enhance 7,665 linear feet of intermittent  streams and 48.6 acres of riparian buffer habitat.  The proposed work is w ithin the Sabine River watershed, within the USGS Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC)  12010005 (Lower Sabine) and is proposed to serve as co mpensatory mitigation for unavoidable, permitted impacts to waters of the United States  within the watershed.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION:  The specific objectives of the project are to restore the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the site.   MITIGATION:   The applicant proposes to construct a compensatory mitigation bank .  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is currently best described as agricultural land ( in grazing & hay production) with impaired streams and wetland riparian buffer communities. Three (3) unnamed tributaries to Trout Creek converge within the project site, before flowing northeast and eventually merging with Big Cow Creek, a major tributary to  the Sabine River. Historic ranch management practices have resulted in the removal of virtually all woody vegetation buffering the unnamed tributaries and a corresponding exposure of stream channels to direct sunlight. Unrestricted, continual grazing and mowing practices have resulted in increased erosion, deeply incised channels, increased sedimentation loads, and reduced water quality.  Current habitat onsite is described as farmed wetlands with improved pasture dominated by Bermuda grass ( Cynodon dactylon ), Bahia grass ( Paspalum notatum ), smut grass (Sporobolus indicus ), and Vasey’s grass ( Paspalum urvillei ). Woody vegetation occurring only along the primary tributary consists of isolated Chinese tallow tree ( Triadica sebifera) and black willow (Salix nig ra), with an occasional w ater oak ( Quercus nigra).   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant. This project information has not been verified by the Corps. As of the date of this Public Notice, the Corps has received but not yet finalized the verified the we tland delineation or the functional assessment . The applicant’s prospectus and associated documents  are enclosed.  A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required. Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.  Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the Clean Water Act (CWA).   OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     The project site is not located within the Texas Coastal Zone and therefore, does not require certification from the Texas Coastal Management Program.     The proposed project will trigger review under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality will review this application under Section 401 of the CWA and in accordance with Title 30, Texas Administrative Code Section 279.1-13 to determine if the work would comply with State water quality standards.

The project can be located on the U.S.G.S. quadrangle map titled:  LaPorte and League City, Texas .    LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Starting Latitude :  29.652819° North;  Longitude :  095.030006° West  Ending Latitude :  29.582282° North;  Longitude :  095.028887° West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant proposes to permanently discharge fill material into a total of 2.59 acres of wetlands during construction activities associated with improvements to the existing State Highway (SH) 146.  The associated fill activities include grading on banks  along the main lane and frontage road locations, as well as the construction of a concrete batch plant that is required to complete additional work  in addition to the previously authorized project under Nationwide Permit (NWP)               SWG -2006 -00484.   PROJECT HIS TORY:   Department of the Army ( DA) SWG -2006 -00484 verified a  Nationwide Permit (NWP) 14 on 6 March 2009, and expired on 18 March 2012, and authorized a linear transportation project and a structural discharge project.  The permit was conditioned to purchase mitigation bank credits.   DA SWG -2006 -00484 issued on 14 June 2010, and expired on 6 March 2011, reverified  the previous authorization and  replaced  sheet 2 of 9 of the permitted plans showing an incorrect alignment of SH 146 with a  revised plan.   DA SWG -2006 -00484 issued on 24 February 2011, and expired o n 18 March 2012, reverified previous work at three jurisdictional crossings, this NWP 14 is for work associated with construction of three new grade separated overpasses at SH 146 and Wharton W eems Road.   DA SWG -2006 -00484 issued on 16 April 2013, and expired on 18 March 2017, verified  impacts to 0.024 acre of waters and wetlands during construction of a 14 -foot sound  barrier wall and provide drainage through the sound barrier wall through two  culverts and  the associated riprap erosion protection.   In addition, the contractor will have temporary  workspaces within Wetland G, Wetland L -1, and Water N -2 as labeled on the project  plans.   On 13 April 2022, a NWP 14 (SWG -2006 -00484) was verified  by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Galveston District authorizing TxDOT to permanently discharge a total of 2,137 cubic yards of fill material into a total of 0.74 acre of palustrine emergent, palustrine scrub shrub, and estuarine emergent wetlands,  and 54 linear feet of a perennial stream, Taylor Bayou, dispersed throughout  15 single and complete crossings during the improvements to the existing SH 146.  These improvements include culvert extension, placement of a culvert headwall, placement of ripra p, construction of a detention pond, and placement of bridge columns.  The roadway improvements include add ing lanes, sidewalks/side paths, additional frontage road lanes, adding pedestrian bridges, and adding detention ponds.     After NWP SWG -2006 -00484 wa s authorized, TxDOT determined that additional  impacts to Ditch 2, Ditch 3, Ditch 4, Wetland 6, Wetland 7, Wetland 9, Wetland 10, and         Wetland 18 are required.  These additional impacts are due to fill required to accommodate the appropriate grade on banks along the main lane and frontage road locations , as well as construct a  concrete batch plant that is required to complete work associated with the previously authorized project under NWP SWG -2006-00484 .  TxDOT purchased 1.8 wetland credits fo r impacts to Crossing 3 (0.476 acre) and Crossing 12 (0.24 acre) to satisfy the compensatory mitigation requirements for previously authorized NWP SWG -2006 -00484.  The previously permitted and mitigated porti ons of Crossing 3 and Crossing 12 would be deducted from the impact totals and compensatory mitigation under this new  Standard Permit (SP)  application.   A total of 14.96 acres of jurisdictional waters including twenty freshwater wetlands       (9.18  acres), five estuarine wetlands (2.80 acres), and one tidal perennial stream ,     Taylor Bayou  (2.98  acres ) were  identified during the field reconnaissance for this SP project and 3.41 acres of  permanent impacts to jurisdictional waters is anticipated as a result of the proposed project.   A total of 0.7423 acre were previously permitted and mitigated for under  NWP  SWG -2006 -00484.  No additional impacts to jurisdictional waters are anticipated to occur from the changes after SWG -2006 -00484 within the following nine crossings:   Crossing 1, Crossing 2, Crossing 4, Crossing 5, Crossing 10,         Crossing 11, Crossing 13, Crossing 14, and Crossing 15.   Therefore, any proposed construction within those jurisdictional waters is authorized and authorized  to begin under the NWP SWG -2006 -00484 , which was issued on 13 April 2022.  A total of 2. 60 acre of additional impacts to jurisdictional waters are proposed  within the following six crossings:  Crossing 3, Crossing 6, Crossing 7, Crossing 8, Crossing 9, and Crossing 12;  and therefore , will be evaluated under this SP  application .   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant proposes to minimiz e impacts for the completion of construction by staying within the existing right-of-way ( ROW ).  All proposed improvements within the wetlands have been minimized to the extent practicable to still accomplish project objectives by avoiding 11.6287 acres of the        14.96 acres of WOUS within the project area.   With the large amount of commercial/residential properties and staying within existi ng ROW, route realignment options to reduce impacts to  waters of the US  were limited, but impacts could not be completely avoided.  Compensatory mitigation is required for unavoidable impacts to 3.3413 acres of wetlands and 8.4 FCUs (0.7423 acre/1.8 FCU pre viously permitted) at Gulf Coastal Plains MB.  Compensatory mitigation for this SP would include 6.6 FCUs for 2.60 acres.     MITIGATION:   The applicant has stated that compensatory mitigation is required for unavoidable impacts to 3. 3413 acres of wetlands to taling 8.1 FCUs                                           (of which 0.7423 acre/1.8 FCU is previously permitted and purchased) at Gulf Coastal Plains Mitigation Bank (GCPMB).   Compensatory mitigation for this SP would include  an additional  6.6 FCUs for 2. 60 acres  of impacts .    The Gulf Coastal Plains Mitigation Bank has a service area that overlaps the proposed project area.   The project area occurs within the secondary service area for this bank, so a 1.5 multiplier is required.  The bank also only releases credits in a credit su ite, meaning an equal amount in each Functional Capacity Unit (FCU) category determined by the highest value must be purchased.   The Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains utilizes             HGM interim (HGMi) assessments to mandate credits of wetlands or other water of th e U.S. that are adversely impacted.  This bank recognizes the HGMi assessment method and for credit purchases combines Palustrine Emergent (PEM) wetlands and       Palustrine Scrub -Shrub (PSS) wetlands into one credit.   A Wetland Functional Assessment Report was c ompleted detailing the calculations for determining the functional loss of Temporary Storage & Detention of Storage Water (TSDSW),       Maintain Plant and Animal Communities (MPAC), and Removal & Sequestration of Elements & Compounds (RSEC) anticipated from una voidable impacts to wetlands as a result of the proposed project.   HGMi functional assessments that were completed for the four crossings which would require mitigation.   TxDOT previously purchased 0.6 FCU for TSDSW, MPAC, and RSEC totaling 1.8 FCUs  under NWP SWG -2006 -00484 .  TxDOT proposes to purchase an additional 6.6 FCUs  for 2.60 acres of impacts  to fulfill the additional mitigation requirements for impacts associated with this SP application.  Since Gulf Coastal Plains Mitigation Bank sells credits in a credit suite for PSS/PEM impacts, 2. 2 FCUs of each TSDSW, MPAC, and RSEC (6.6 FCUs total) are required to mitigate for impacts to PSS/PEM.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  Currently, the project area consists of a mix of single -family residential, commercial, industrial, and open space/undeveloped parcels.   The open space/undeveloped parcels are dominated by pasture with scattered wooded areas, primarily along the streams.  Dominant habitat types are urban and riparian in the existing ROW.  The project site conditions contains palustrine emergent, palustrine scrub shrub, and estuarine emergent wetlands, and the waters of Taylor Bayou, which are adjacent to the ROW of SH 146.  The project site is limited at  the north by West Fairmont Parkway and limited at the south by Red Bluff Road.

CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  is currently an undeveloped tract of land  that contains 42.941 acres of forested, scrub/shrub and emergent wetlands.  During a field investigation, multiple mosaic forested wetland communities were observed within the project area.  The forested wetland communities were dominated by similar plant  species consisting of green ash ( Fraxinus pennsylvanica ), water oak ( Quercus nigra ),   red maple ( Acer rubrum ), sweetgum ( Liquidambar styraciflua ), and dwarf palmetto    (Sabal minor ).  Upland communities were also delineated and were found to be dominate d by water oak and Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera ).  The subject wetlands are adjacent to Cedar Bayou, a traditional navigable water (TNW), and are located approximately 0.5 -mile west of the subject site.  The site also contains one tributary (TRIB1 - 1265.32 linear feet).   Wetlands 1, 2, 3 and 5, totaling 30.47 acres, were determined to be adjacent to Cedar Bayou and are waters of the United States subject to Section 404 of the CWA.

Placement of material would be based on available sediment quantity within areas with the most need for nourishmentdue to ongoing erosion. The construction width includes a 200- foot berm crest at an elevation of +4.0 feet NAVD88, a variable slope to the toe of fill, and a variable fill density.The resulting placement density (volume per linear foot of nourished beach) along the project length would vary due to the varying quantities of material needed to construct the beach and provide nourishment. The placement of sand material on the beach w ould primarily occur by dredge pipeline. Sand placement from authorized upland sites would occur viatruck hauling. Truck hauling would include the use of sand brought to Access Roads 5 and 6, where it would be stockpiled and transported to the project are a by large off -road dump trucks. Front -end loaders would then grade sand placed within the construction corridor to create the authorized beach template. The dredge pipeline would deliversand from authorized borrow areas to the project area by hopper dredge with a pump -out station(s) located offshore.

Contractor routes the pipeline to shore at one location and then adds dredge pipeline on the beach as progress is made towards the Active Construction Area, or 2. Contractor would have multiple landing locations for the pipeline and the pipeline would be routed along the seafloor to a location near the Active Construction Area. An Active Construction Area is the area on the beach where dredged material is discharged and mechanically moved to construct the beach and dune profile. Heavy equipment operators would create temporary earthen training berms, which would partially contain and direct the slurry exiting the dredge pipe. As this slurry runs along the beach, sediment would settle out within the project template and water would return to the Gulf of Mexico. As sediment builds up in front of the pipe, heavy equipment would gradethe sediment to meet the project template. Operation of heavy equipment would primarily be limited to the Active Construction Area. However, equipment and personnel would travel portions of the beach for crew changes and transfer of equipment/supplies to the working area. Beach construction equipment would be stored near Active Construction Areas above the high tide line. The temporary dredge pipe located on land would be placed below or above the existing grade to allow vehicular access. Upon removal of the dredge pipe, all disturbed areas would be filled, graded, and compacted to allow vehicle access at project completion. Sand Borrow AreasSuitable sand material for beach nourishment would be supplied from beneficial use borrow sources located near the entrance of the Brazos Santiago Pass (Borrow Areas A - C).

AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION:  The project is one of the Texas General Land Office's (TGLO) Coastal Erosion Planning and Response Act (CEPRA) projects that is recognized as having erosional concerns. As such, no offsite alternatives were considered for beach nourishment. Each onsite alternative includes the placement of suitable sand material along 12 miles or shoreline where, once the project is constructed, natural processes will mov e sand from the upper part of the beach into the nearshore area to match the natural equilibrium beach shape. The preferred alternative was determined from modeling storm breaches and feasibility and logistics of the proposed project .  MITIGATION:   No compensatory mitigation is proposed.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The beach profile differs slightly from the starting location (south) to the end location (north) within the project area with differences most notable at the dune line. The southern end of the project area near Beach Access Roads 4 and 5 is slightly  wider and consists of one relatively continuous and vegetated dune profile. The dune profile becomes less continuous north of Beach Access Road 5 with the dune slope shifting westward towards State  Park Road 100 and gradually decreasing in percent vegetation cover and then becoming unvegetated sand dunes approximately  0.80 mile north of Beach Access Road 5. Beach and dune width, as well as  percent vegetation cover along the dunes, then varies for approximately 4 miles before becoming unvegetated sand dunes about 0.40 mile south of the end of State Park  Road 100, about halfway in the project area. Hay bales were observed within this reach of beach,  from approximately 2.30 miles south of the end of St ate Park Road 100. Based on location and  orientation of the hay bales, they are assumedly for the purpose of dune restoration as part of a separate project and conducted by a different entity.   The first approximate 0.70 mile of the project area beyond State Park Road 100 consists of wide  beach with the dune slope located west of an imaginary line if State Park Road 100 were extended  northward. Farther northward, dunes within the project area var y between continuous, densely  vegetated dunes that extend eastward creating a narrow beach and patchy dunes with short  foredunes and multiple dune breaks associated with wide beaches and large areas of unvegetated sand dunes. The most northern 3 miles of the project are within the LANWR.

The drainage channel will begin at a point along SH 99/146 East and continue  to a point south of Evergreen Road near Tabbs Bay.   BACKGROUND: Department of the Army (DA) Nationwide Permit (NWP) verification SWG -1992 -01589 w as issued on 16 December 2014, and authorized temporary placement of fill material into 0.06 acre of wetlands and 0.01 acre of waters of the      United States, and permanent placement of fill material into 0.08 acre of wetlands and 0.21 acre of waters of the United States , at four separate single and complete crossings of aquatic resources, for the purpose of construct ing roadway improvements along the Segment I -2 of State Highway 99.   A separate DA NWP verification for temporary access along the transpor tation corridor was issued 4 January 2016, and authorized temporary placement of fill material into     0.56 acre of Wetland B and Cedar Bayou, for construction access and dewatering activities, during the construction of roadway improvements along the project route of Segment I -2.  These two authorizations expired on 19 March 2017.  DA NWP verification was issued on 24 May 2018 and authorized the temporary discharge of fill material into 0.3 acre of wetlands and waters of the United States, and the permanent discharge of fill material into 0.31 acre of wetlands and waters of the United States.   Additional, t emporary access and a change in materials were necessary for this project.  DA NWP verifications for this project were transferred to Grand Parkway Infrastructure, LLC on 13 May 2020  and were scheduled to expire on 22 March 2022.   The project currently pro posed project is separate but related to the impacts listed in the background section above.  The applicant propos ed design modifications to                   State Highway 99 (Grand  Parkway), Segment I -2, from SH 225 to I -10 in Chambers and Harris Countie s, Texas.  The Grand Parkway,  Segment I -2 would consist of a 15 -mile, controlled access throughway , with four main lane s, and intermittent frontage  roads located within a variable width (250 - to 400 -foot) right -of-way.  The Grand Parkway, Segment I -2 received a Record of Decision (ROD) for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on 13 August 1998,  and construction has started on this project.  In 2021, changes were proposed to the project design , and include design changes to accommodate additional dr ainage.  The proposed drainage design changes are located in Harris County, Texas , and are the subject of this permit application.      AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by utilizing an existing stream channel as a drainage way .  The applicant has provided an alternative analysis and proposes to provide compensatory mitigation for the proposed impacts to aquatic resources.   MITIGATION: The applicant proposed to mitigate for the proposed impacts by constructing a permittee responsible mitigation (PRM) project.  The PRM project includes  enhancement and restoration of approximately 14 acres of wetlands and 5,407 linear feet of stream.  The goals of the compensatory mitigation proposal are to maintain the    aquatic ecosystem functions and hydrologic conditions within Galveston Bay watershed.  Compensatory mitigation would replace the chemical, physical, and biological functions of wetlands and other aquatic resources that are los t or degraded as a result of the proposed project.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site c urrently  consists of marsh and scrubby uplands in the northern portion and oak -dominated  woods in the southern portion.   An area of open water is present from a culvert beneath the existing highway  along the northern boundary of the project area, extending south approximately 640 feet.   A deeply incised  stream is present from the central portion of the project area southward, flowing south underneat h Evergreen  Road and into Tabbs Bay.   A small portion of estuarine wetlands are present along the stream south of  Evergreen Road.   The project area is within an active oil and gas field, with multiple active pumps nearby.   Gravel roads are present within t he oil and gas field.   NOTES: This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.

The final design of the project at stream crossings resulted in an 80% reduction in unavoidable stream impacts, specifically from 10,634 linear feet proposed in the initial project designs to 2,164 LF in the final design.  During construction and operation of the project, best management practices (BMPs) will be in place to reduce the potential for erosion and water quality impacts to waters of the US outside of the project fo otprint.   MITIGATION:   The applicant propose s to mitigate for unavoidable impacts to waters of the US  by purchasing 64 mitigation credits from the Blue Elbow Swamp Mitigation Bank (BESMB) .  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project s ite consists of the existin g US 69 corridor within an approximately 300 -foot-wide right -of-way (ROW).   The area is mostly flat, and is comprised of pine plantations, a mix of single -family residential and commercial developments, and agricultural land.  The dominant soil orders in the  project area are Alfisols and Ultisols.  They are generally very deep, moderately well drained to very poorly drained, and loamy or clayey.  The area supports pine -hardwood forest vegetation characterized by longleaf pine.  Sweetgum ( Liquidambar styraciflua ), black gum       (Nyssa sylvatica ), post oak ( Quercus stellata ), blackjack oak ( Quercus marilandica ), and southern red oak ( Quercus falcata ) are the principal hardwood species.   Hawthorns  (Crataegus spp. ), wax myrtle ( Morella spp. ) and shining sumac ( Rhus copal lina) make up the woody understory.  Mid and tall grasses are dominant in open areas.

PERMITTEE : GENERAL PUBLIC   ISSUING OFFICE : U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, GALVESTON DISTRICT   2000 Fort Point Road   Galveston, Texas 77550   LOCATION:   The project area is Lake Livingston, an impoundment of the Trinity River, in Polk, San Jacinto, Walker and Trinity Counties, Texas    PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (Corps) proposes to re -issue a Programmatic and Regional General Permit to authorize structures and work limited to single- family  and multi -family recreational piers . Authorized structures associated with piers shall include, boat houses/shelters, storage buildings, lifts, hoists, personal watercraft ramps/platforms and dry hydrants on Lake Livingston . Structures will be limited to a maximum of 2500 square feet in gross plan view .  BACKGROUND:  Programmatic and Regional General Permits are a type of general permit  (GP) designed to authorize certain activities that have no more than minimal individual and cumulative adverse environmental effects and generally comply with the related laws cited in 33 CFR 320.3. Activities that result in more than minimal individual and cumulative adverse environmental effects cannot be authorized by P rogrammatic and Regional G Ps. Individual review of each activity authorized will be performed. Potential adverse impacts and compliance with the laws cited in 33 CFR 320.3 are controlled by the terms and conditions of each Programmatic and Regional G P that is undertaken during the development of the Programmatic and Regional G P.     In 2008, the Trinity River Authority (TRA) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Corps to administer the R egional GP as a Programmatic General Permit (PGP) through their Lake Livingston Project office for project s that meet the permit conditions and are on TRA-owned submerged land.  PGP SWG -2007 -00720 was last re-issued on October 17, 2018, and will expire Dec ember 31, 2022 (attached) .  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  Lake Livingston is a reservoir located in the East Texas Piney Woods. Lake Livingston was built, and is owned and operated, by the Trinity River Authority of Texas (TRA) under contract with the City of Houston for water -supply purposes. The lake is the second- largest lake located wholly within the state of Texas. The Livingston Dam, constructed across the Trinity River , is approximately 7 miles southwest of the city of Livingston , is 2.5 miles in length,  and has an average depth of 55 feet. The earth- fill dam with concrete spillway was comp leted in 1969.  Lake Livingston has a surface area of 83,000 acres and impounds 1,750,000- acre feet of water at its normal pool elevation of 131 feet above mean sea lev el. The average depth of the lake is 23 feet with a maximum depth of 90 feet. Lake Livingston has more than 450 miles of shoreline extending into San Jacinto, Polk, Walker, and Trinity Counties , Texas .  OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     The General Permit is  not valid in waters subject to Texas’ approved Coastal Management Program .  The General Permit does not authorize discharges regulated by the State of Texas’ Section 401 program.   Proposed activities requiring permission under Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (33 USC 408) because the activity, in whole or in part, would alter, occupy, or use a Corps Civil Works project will be evaluated on a case- by-case basis.   NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES:   Pre -construction notification will allow the Corps, on a case- by-case basis, to evaluate  each proposed project site for National Register of Historic Places.  No structures, work, or fill authorized by this General Permit may affect historic properties lis ted or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places is authorized until the Corps and applicant has complied with the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. In addition, if any previously unknown historic or archeological remains are discovered while constructing the structure authorized by this permit, the permittee must immediately stop work and notify this office of what you have found. We will initiate the Federal and state coordination required to determine if the remains warrant a recovery effort or if the site is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places .      THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES:  The General Permit has been conditioned to prohibit the take of a listed species.  Pre -construction notification will allow the Corps, on a case- by-case basis, to evaluate effects to federally listed threatened and endangered species and their critical habitat.   ESSENTIAL F ISH HABITAT:   The General Permit is not valid in waters with Essential Fish Habitat.   PUBLIC INTEREST REVIEW FACTORS:   This application will be reviewed in accordance with 33 CFR 320- 332, the Regulatory Programs of the Corps of Engineers, and other pertinent laws, regulations and executive orders.  The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the  national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefits, which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors, which may be relevant t o the proposal, will be considered:  among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion and acc retion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.

MITIGATION:   The applicant propose s to mitigate for the proposed impacts by reserving/purchasing 43.2 compensatory Functional Capacity Units  (FCU)  from the      Gulf Coastal Plains Mitigation Bank (GCPMB)  operated by East Bay Farms, LLC  (a subsidiary of the Earth Partners, LP) .  37.6 FCUs have been purchased with 5.6 FCUs being reserved with a down payment  to cover the 38.37 -acres of overall wetland impacts .  The 37.6 FCUs are broken down as follows (0.1 physical units, 16.7 chemical units , and      20.8 biological units).     CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site , Advario North America facility (formerly Oiltanking North America), is located adjacent  to the Texas Ship Channel and     Galveston West Bay , south of the Texas City Dike .  The project site is approximately   224-acres of undeveloped land composed of uplands, wetlands and open wate r surrounded by other industrial development.   The wetland composition delineated onsite includes the following:   EEM 2.5 acres;  PEM 26.34 acres; PFO 2.25 acres; and PSS 16.06 acres.   The project site is split between East Lagoon and Lake Institute.   Histori cally, the tract of land operated as a dredge placement area between 1963 and 1964, and later operated as a wastewater treatment facility and was used as a “flow through/retention time” basin between  1964  to 1983  for Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) .  A leve e was constructed around the perimeter of th e property as part of the wastewater treatment basin.   The containment levee separates open water and wetlands from the adjacent Texas City S hip Channel and unnamed stormwater control canals.   On 3 June 1994, EPA R egion 6 approved clean closure of East Lagoon under 40 CFR        Part 264, EPA I.D. No. TXD980626782  stating that a post -closure permit for the unit was not required.   The other portion of the property, designated as Lake Institute , operated as an approved dredg e placement area between 1977 to 1991.   Removal of industrial sold waste, hazardous waste and waste residues occurred in early 2000s.   The TCEQ issued approval of remediation of hazardous waste on 20 November 2003 and  released          Lake Institute from post -closu re care responsibilities on 9 August 2004  by complying with non-residential soil criteria under Risk Reduction Standard No. 2 .  The lagoons were closed as Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) waste units and are not currently permitted for waste d isposal.   The applicant is reapplying for authorization for the proposed TIDE project, consistent with the USACE requirements to provide an approved Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP), after withdrawal 20 November 2019.   NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 21 sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicates that a n Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant  nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA .

The method is a  rapid  assessment tool to help distinguish between ephem eral, intermittent, and perennial streamflow at the reach scale for the Northern and Southern Great Plains SDAM Regions . The beta SDAM may help provide technical guidance for identifying waters that may be subject to regulatory jurisdiction under  Section 404 of the Clean Water Act ; however , this method does not alter or change the definition of “ Waters of the U.S. ”   The beta SDAM was developed for use in all or part of the states of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,  Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas , Wisconsin, and Wyoming  by the Corps  and EPA (Figure 1). This beta  method results from a literature review and field  study conducted at 251 stream reaches across the range of hydrologic landscapes of the Great Plains  from 2019  to 2021. Developed through statistical analyses  of the field data, it provides a data -driven approach using nine  reliable indicators to d etermine  streamflow duration  class at the reach scale. The agencies are making this  beta SDAM available for a one-year preliminary implementation and comment period to inform the development  of a final SDAM for the Great Plains .    The beta SDAM  for the Great Plains  can be applied  whenever there is uncertainty regarding streamflow duration  class  and a rapid evaluation method is desired . The method provides a scientifically supported, rapid assessment framework to support best professional judgment in a consistent, robust, repeatabl e, and defensible way.  Use of the method may  result in timelier and more predictable  jurisdictional determinations and is also useful where knowledge of streamflow duration class improves ecological assessment, management, and decision -making. The beta SDA M was developed specifically from data collected in the Great Plains . Though there is a single SDAM for the entire Great Plains, the method incorporates a geographical indicator for differences between Southern Great Plains and Northern Great Plains .  The method, d ata forms , and training opportunities  are available on the internet at:  https://www.epa.gov/streamflow - duration -assessment/beta -streamflow -duration -assessment -method -great -plains    Practitioners such as stream ecologists, aquatic ecologists, hydrologists, and wetland scientists ar e encouraged to comment on their experience using the  beta SDAM . Comments regarding the following specific topics would be especially useful:  Joint Public Notice    Notice of Availability of the  Beta Streamflow Duration Assessment Method for the Great Plains  Issue Date: September 28, 20 22  US Army Corps of Engineers   US Environmental Protection Agency    • Problem situations encountered and possible approaches for addressing them . • Apparently, incorrect results, inclu ding the factors that suggest the method was in accurate . • Indicators that were particularly useful or not useful in identifying flow duration in different hydrological environments . • Regional differences in the applicability of specific indicators . • Potential uses of the method in the regulatory context, or in other watershed planning or management contexts.

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude :  29.748748° North;  Longitude :  094.003184° West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant proposes to beneficially use dredged material to restore approximately 1,951.02 acres of estuarine marsh in the JD Murphree Wildlife Management Area – Salt Bayou Unit.  The restoration area will be comprised of              nine separate cells.   A perimeter  berm will be created around each cell using borrow material mechanically dredged from the interior of the cell.   Upon completion of cells, hydraulically dredged material will be beneficially placed to restore soil elevations within the cell to a level that  will support emergent wetlands.  The discharge of approximately              7,836,125 cubic yards of fill material into approximately 1,951 acres is necessary for the construction of the containment levees and training d ikes, and to restore soil elevation s within the cells.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that marsh restoration in this area will require placing fill material over the existing wetlands and benthic regions.  While benthic organisms found in the existing bottom substrate  at the time of construction will be covered, the newly deposited material will provide a sufficient source for          benthic colonization, and recolonization is expected to occur quickly.  No loss of wetlands is expected; conversely, all 1,352.25 acres of wetlan ds within the project area would be enhanced and are expected to increase in function and value, and an additional        598.52 acres of wetlands would be created in areas that are now open water.   For these reasons, the applicant believes the project is self -mitigating and does not require alternate forms of compensation for the temporary impacts.   MITIGATION:   The applicant is not proposing mitigation for this project.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  consists of an approximate      2,331.512 -acre area that is predominantly comprised of brackish/estuarine marsh and open  water .

Thes e soils consist of BaA - Bancker mucky peat, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded, tidal, and CsA - Creole mucky peat, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded, tidal.  Approximately      0.676 acres of the project area is comprised of upland herbaceous/s hrub habitats.  Uplands within the project area consists of a shell mid den, a levee, and a manmade canal berm.   Wetlands identified within the project area (1,684.638 acres) consist of  herbaceous marsh wetlands.  Dominant vegetation species occurring withi n these wetlands include saltwater cordgrass ( Spartina alterniflora ), saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens ), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata ), common reed ( Phragmites australis ), turtleweed ( Batis maritima ), Jesuit’s -Bark ( Iva frutescens ), and woody saltwor t  (Salicornia depressa ).  Wetlands within the project area are at or near sea level elevation.   The subject wetlands are adjacent to  Keith Lake, Johnson Lake, Shell Lake, Salt Lake, and Salt Bayou .

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:  29.290403° North;  Longitude:  094.964547° West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant proposes to discharge approximately   400,000 cubic -yards of clean native fill into approximately 22.449 acres and   mechanically dredge approximately 0.47  acre (2 ,288 cubic -yards) of open water associated with the completion of previously authorized work captured under               SWG -2007- 00597.  Such activities include the completion of a previously authorized marina, floating docks, bulkheads, and bank stabilization for a canal lot subdivision.   PERMIT HISTORY AND BACKGROUND :  Historically , the subject property was developed in the mid- 1960's and originally platted an approximately 3,600- acre area south of the City of Hitchcock to be developed into an expansive canal lot residential area and marina.  Twenty -two canals w ere completely dredged with depths ranging from - 5 to -12 feet.  Eight canals were partially dredged to depths ranging between - 2 and - 3 feet.  While the applicant was constructing Flamingo Isles, he lost his financing and was forced to abandon the construction of the site.   At th at time, five houses had been constructed and several thousand feet of bulkhead had been installed.  Since the 1960's, many developers attempted to finish the original applicant’s  project.   However, due to inadequate financing or other problems, they were un able to complete the development.   June 21, 2001 – Authorized the f ill of 4.2 acres of interior brackish wetlands, 4.9 acres of smooth cordgrass wetlands, 0.4 acres of sandflats, a nd 25 acres of shallow to deep water habitat to complete the construction of a residential canal lot subdivision and marina to be known as Flamingo Isles.  In addition, 0.2 acres of interior brackish wetlands, 4.1 acres of smooth cordgrass wetlands, 0.5 acres of sand flats, and 44.2 acres of shallow to deep water habitat will be dredged.  As compensation for the impacts due to filling and dredging, the applicant will restore a 40- acre marsh located within a 139.31- acre area designated as a dredge material placement area for marsh restoration.  The applicant will also deed restrict a 185 -acre area located at the southwest corner of the project site.   This area, a high- quality functioning freshwater to brackish m arsh, will be preserved by conservation easement and deeded to a recipient at a  later date.  The applicant will also construct an  on-site sewage treatment plant.  The effluent from the plant will be directed through existing wetlands prior to its discharge into the Diversionary Canal and   Galveston Bay.   Furthermore, the applicant will install 22 interconnecting culverts, 24- inch in diameter, between canals to increase the tidal flow between them.   August 19, 2009 - To amend the original authorization, Department of the Army (DA) Permit Number 22079, to extend time to perform previously authorized work, to retain a portion of unauthorized impacts, and to authorize additional impacts for the construction of a marina and canal lot subdivision located adjacent to Galveston Bay.   The project development plan, which included the previously authorized/unauthorized and proposed work will impact 5.41 acres of interior marsh, 9.53 acres of Spartina wetlands, 0.75 acre of sand flats, 126.57 acres of open water, and the excav ation of 6.25 acres of uplands to create open water.  The project will also consist of the construction of 17.06 acres of     new structures located over open water including marina piers, private boathouses, private piers, fishing/boating/kayak piers, and access boardwalks.  The canals within the development vary from a depth of - 7 feet to a maximum depth of - 9 feet.  The unauthorized impacts consist of 0.64 acre of interior marsh, 1.47 acres of spartina wetlands, 0.07 acre of sand flats, and 65.73 acres of open water habitat.  Unauthorized  activities also include the excavation of 8.42 acres of uplands lastly, 3.37 acres of unauthorized structures also exist, including Marina pi ers, private boathouses, and  private pi ers.  A portion of the unauthorized impacts will be restored in the proposed project development plan.  This authorization impacts differ from the originally authorized impacts by an increase of 1.01 acres of interior marsh, 1.53 acre of spartina wetlands, 57.37 acres of open water, 5.27 acres of fill and 52.1 acres of dredging.  The dredge material from the proposed dredging will be placed on- site.  To medicate for the additional impacts, 7 acres of salt marsh will be created in four sections of uplands located along the western bank of the Highland Bayou Diversion Channel, in Galveston County, Texas.  The previously authorized mitigation under DA Permit 22079 consisted of restoring          40 acres of marsh located within a 139.31- acre area located at the southwest corner of the project site.  The applicant also placed a 185- acre area into a conservation easement and deeded it to a third party.  This mitigation remains as a requirement of this permit .  The project will be conducted in accordance with the attached plans.   July 6, 2010  - Transfer requested for SWG -2007- 00597 from Harborwalk, LP to P.I. Holdings.   June 26, 2016  - The applicant proposes to perform maintenance dredging of the Harborwalk Marina Channel.  The channel will be mechanically dredged to a depth of        -8 feet.   Approximately 5,880 cubic yards of material will be removed and will be placed in an upland placement area located approximately 0.25 mile to the northwest of the channel's center.  Berms will be constructed around the perimeter of the placement area in order to contain the dredged material to be placed.  The berms will be constructed using existing material located at the placement area and silt fences will be installed.  Dredging of the channel and the use of the upland placement area were originally authorized under DA Permit 22079.  The permit has undergone an amendment and extension of time.  The permit expired on 31 December 2014 and the applicant is in the process of seeking an extension of time.  The applicant was  solely seeking authorization to perform the minimum amount of maintenance dredging of the Harborwalk Marina Channel needed to provide safe boating access to residents and users of Harborwalk's marina and subdivision.   August 12, 2022 - At this time, the applicant is solely seeking authorization to complete work as previously  authorized under Permit Numbers 22079 and SWG -2007- 00597.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION:   The applicant has stated that previously authorized works avoided and minimized impacts to adjacent wetlands and waters.  Majority of work to be completed is within the par tially constructed marina and canal residential area.     MITIGATION:   The applicant has stated that the mitigation requirements of the original permit (22079) were completed during the term of that permit.  Those mitigation requirements included beneficial use of dredged material in the Pierce Marsh north of Harborwalk, a 40- acre marsh res toration project west of Harborwalk, deed restriction of 185 acres of existing marsh west of Harborwalk, and habitat creation along the north side of Harborwalk.   There was a 25- acre parcel deed restricted as part of a settlement agreement for the unauthori zed activities associated with an after the fact  (ATF)  permit.  The revised ATF permit (SWG -2007- 00597) issued in 2009 required an additional 7 acres of salt marsh creation to compensate for the unauthorized and new impacts authorized by that new permit.   Therefore, it appears all previously required mitigation under 22079 and SWG -2007- 00597 have been completed even though some of the impacts authorized by the 2009 permit have not yet been completed (the subject of this permit reissuance request).  No additio nal mitigation is proposed.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project area is a mostly -completed canal residential development with associated marina originally authorized in the 1960s and with authorized development continuing up to permit expiration in 2015.  Several areas within the previously authorized footprint have not been fully completed prior to permit expiration.  Those remaining areas subject of this permit re- authorization request are largely previously disturbed with fill, grading, or excavation.  Current conditions include bare exposed soils, weedy /brushy upland areas, wetland vegetation along water lines or areas subject to inundation, and open water of various depths.  Typical wetland vegetation along disturbed water lines or disturbed areas subject to inundation includes cattails ( Typha sp.), spi kerush ( Eleocharis sp. ), bulrush ( Schoenoplectus sp. ),          smooth cordgrass ( Spartina alterniflora), marshhay cordgrass ( Spartina patens ), saltgrass ( Distichlis spicata ), saltwort ( Batis maritima ), and glasswort                      (Salicornia virginica ).  Weedy or brushy vegetat ion on disturbed uplands includes baccharis ( Baccharis halimifolia), dewberry ( Rubus trivialis ), prickly pear                   (Opuntia englemannii ), ragweed ( Ambrosia sp. ), goldenrod ( Solidago sp. ), and various other grasses and forbs .  NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.   The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 8 sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA .    OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     Consistency with the State of Texas Coastal Management Plan is required.   The applicant has stated that the proposed activity complies with Texas’ approved Coastal Management Program goals and policies and will be conducted in a manner consistent with said program.

NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES:   The staff archaeologist has  reviewed the latest published version of the National Register of Historic Places, lists of properties determined eligible, and other sources of information.  The following is current knowledge of the presence or absence of hi storic properties and the effects of the undertaking upon these properties:    The permit area has been so extensively impacted by previous residential development, dredging, and placement of dredged material that there is no potential for historic properties to exist within the permit area.  Therefore, the proposed project has no potential to effect historic properties.   THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES:   Preliminary indications are that no known threatened and/or endangered species or their critical habitat will be affected by the proposed work.   ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT:   This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat consultation requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on Essential Fish  Habitat or federally  managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.     PUBLIC INTEREST REVIEW FACTORS:   This application will be reviewed in accordance with 33 CFR 320- 332, the Regulatory Programs of the Corps , and other pertinent laws, regulations and executive orders.

MITIGATION :  The applicant proposes to construct a compensatory mitigation bank .  WATER RIGHTS ACQUISITION:  The applicant has stated the project will not need diverted hydrology to be sustained in perpetuity.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The site was forested through the 1970’s and then cleared sometime circa 1980. The Bank has been maintained as open land and used for cattle or hay production over the last 40 years . Natural topography within most of the Bank is slightly undulating and bisected with small strea ms and drainages. Water flows across the site generally from the west and northwest and drains toward Big Cow Creek.    The Bank is partially located in the floodplain of Big Cow Creek. The eastern and northeast portions are entirely included in FEMA design ated flood zone A or 100- year floodplain of Big Cow Creek . The Bank consists of agricultural land (cattle grazing) with wetland and upland hardwood forests and wetland and upland herbaceous communities. Riverine forested wetlands occur within the Bank and are contiguous with adjacent bottomland hardwood forests along Big Cow Creek. The Bank is primarily open with remnant forested areas along drainages and side slope seeps.    Wetland herbaceous/shrub vegetation communities are present along the central north/south stream corridor and within the hillside seep wetland just west of this stream corridor on the slope grading into the floodplain. Wetland forests occur along Big Cow Creek and the tributaries along the southern boundary of the Bank.   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.

LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:  29.9454 3° North ; Longitude:  95.91707° West   PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The  sponsor  proposes the establishment and operation of a 955-acre mitigation bank named the Sand Hill Farm Mitigation Bank. The sponsor ’s plan is to re -establish approximately 228 acres of emergent wetlands, rehabilitate 15.4 acres of emergent and scrub -shrub wetlands  and re -establish 12,400 linear feet of intermittent stream. The project work is being conducted within the Spring USGS Hydrologic Unit Code 12040102 to serve as compensatory mitigation for unavoidable, permitted impacts to waters of the United States.  Sponsor has stated that the bank will not need diverted hydrology to maintain wetland hydrology parameters.   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION:  The specific objectives of the project are to restore the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the sit e.  MITIGATION:   The applicant proposes to construct a compensatory mitigation bank .  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is currently an undeveloped agricultural tract of land surrounded by more undeveloped agricultural land. The subject wetlands are adjacent  to Live Oak Creek, a tributary to Spring Creek. There are six predominant vegetation communities present: row crop agriculture, hay pasture, livestock grazing pasture, fallow agricultural land, riparian corridor, and recently plowed agricultural  fields.    Dominant vegetation across the site varies seasonally . The vegetation communities at the time of the delineation, are summarized below:   • The western portion (west of Penick Road) consists mostly of watermelon production on the north and south sides of Live Oak Creek. Watermelon fields contained other species that included hogwort ( Croton capitatus ), Bermudagrass ( Cynodon dactylon), spiny amaranth ( Amaranthus spinosus ), and various other species. This portion of the site also contained recently plowed areas with little to no vegetation and a planted sunflower field.   • Much of the area adjac ent to Live Oak Creek consists of forested and shrub -scrub riparian habitat dominated by an overstory of sugarberry ( Celtis laevigata ) and Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera ) and a mid/understory that includes Chinese privet ( Ligustrum sinense), southern dewberry ( Rubus trivialis ), and poison ivy ( Toxicodendron radicans ).   • The northeastern portion of the site (east of Penick Rd and northeast of Live Oak Creek) is primarily dominated by Bermudagrass, hogwort, and deep- rooted sedge ( Cyperus entrerianus ). This  area is used primarily for livestock grazing.  • The southeast portion of the site (east of Penick Rd and west of Live Oak Creek) is dominated by vine mesquite ( Panicum obtusum ) in the northern area (hay pasture), Bermudagrass in the southern area (hay pasture), and row crop corn field in the central area.   • The southeast portion of the site (east of Penick Rd and east of Live Oak Creek) is dominated by eastern baccharis ( Baccharis halimifolia ), deep- rooted sedge, southern dewberry, hogwort, annual marsh elder (Iva annua), and Bermudagrass. Wetter areas contained more coverage of Pennsylvania smartweed ( Polygonum pensylvanicum ) and maidencane ( Panicum hemitomon ). This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant. This project information has not been verified by the Corps.  As of the date of this Public Notice, the Corps has received but not yet finalized the verified the Wetland Delineation  or the Functional Assessment . The applicant’s prospectus and associated documents  are enclosed in 73 s heets .  A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required. Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.  Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environm ental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the Clean Water Act (CWA).   OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     The project site is not located within the Texas Coastal Zone and therefore, does not require certification from the Texas Coastal Managem ent Program.     The proposed project will trigger review under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality will review this application under Section 401 of the CWA and in accordance with Title 30, Texas Administrative Code Section 279.1- 13 to determine if the work would comply with State water quality standards.  The applicant has not yet reached out to the Tex as Commission on Environmental Quality  to initiate the Section 401 CWA process.

The applicant has shifted the design to avoid 15,718 linear feet of waters of the US, primarily a tributary of Peach Creek, located  on the project site.   All work around streams will be done above their respective OHWM.   MITIGATION:   The 18.56 acres of delineated wetlands proposed to be impacted were evaluated by Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. using the I nterim Hydrogeomorphic (iHGM) Wetland Functional Assessment for Herbaceous/Scrub -Shrub and Forested wetlands.   It was determined that the total impacts in functional capacity units (FCUs) for             forested wetlands are:   0.08 physical/temporary storage of surface  water (TSSW),        0.09 biological/ maintenance of plant and animal communities (MPAC), and                      0.07 chemical/removal and sequestration of elements and compounds (RSEC).   For herbaceous/scrub -shrub, the impact FCU’s are:   9.31 TSSW, 13.85 MPAC, and             8.35 RSEC.  In tot al, the applicant proposes to purchase 14.0 TSSW FCUs, 14.0 MPAC FCUs, and 14.0 RSEC FCUs  from the Tarkington Bayou Mitigation Bank (TBMB) subject to availability and anticipated release of credits .   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS : The subject property is a 200 -acre tract located within the City of Patton Village in Montgomery County, Texas.  A majority of the project area is in the FEMA 100 -year floodplain.  The proposed project area is a drainage easement within a residential community.   A majority of the project area is wooded, dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) trees.   The hardwoods mixed throughout the site include       post oak (Quercus stellata), live oak (Quercus virginiana), willow oak (Quercus phellos),    water oak (Quercus nigra), southern red oak (Quercus f alcata), American elm           (Ulmus americana), and cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia).   The upland understory is dominated by yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense), and    American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana).   Hogwort (Croton capitatus) and      western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) were found in more open areas.   Although not as common, additional understory vegetation included southern arrow wood       (Viburnum dentatum), sawtooth greenbrier (Smilax bona -nox), roundleaf greenbrier (Smilax rotundifoli a), and southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis).   In wetland areas, the subject property was dominated by maidencane (Panicum hemitomon), willow oak (Quercus phellos), woo lly panic grass (Dichanthelium acuminatum), swamp marigold (Bidens aristosa), and lizard’s tail (Saururus cernuus).   Several detention ponds are within the project area, which are relatively shallow with a mix of emergent and floating vegetation.

The Halls Bayou Mitigation Bank (HBMB) is pending approval; and therefore, does not currently h ave PEM credits available for purchase.  If HBMB  is approved for use  and PEM credits are made available  prior to the permit decision , the applicant plans to purchase 7.696 physical, 10.633 biological, and 7.521 chemical FCUs to sufficiently offset permanen t impacts to PEM wetlands within the project area.   If HBMB is not approved prior to a permit decision and/or PEM credits from HBMB are not available, a         permittee responsible mitigation (PRM) plan will be developed within the HBMB to sufficiently o ffset PEM impacts within the project area.     CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  is currently an undeveloped tract of land within the 100 -year floodplain of Oyster Creek , which is located approximately 1 mile to the south -southwest of the project si te.  There are industrial facilities to the north , south, and west of the project site, and undeveloped land to the east.  Salt Bayou is approximately 1 mile to the east of the project site , and that area appears to consist of a mix of uplands, PEM wetland s, and estuarine emergent wetlands,  according to the National Wetlands Inventory.   A total of 15 wetlands were delineated within the 83.4-acre project survey area, which is located within the Austin -Oyster subbasin [U.S. Geologic Service (USGS) hydrologic unit code (HUC) 12040205 ].  Within these 15 wetlands,    21.77 acres of herbaceous (PEM) wetland and 10.27 acres of palustrine broad -leaved deciduous (PFO1) w etlands, totaling 32.04 acres, were identified.   The forested wetlands on the project site are dominated by  Chinese tallow ( Triadica serbifera ) and Live oak (Quercus virginiana ), while the herbaceous wetlands were dominated by Marsh hay cordgrass ( Spartina  patens ), Gulf cordgrass ( Spartina spartinae ), and  Cherokee sedge (Carex cherokeensis ).  This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.  As of the date of this public notice, the Corps has received but not yet verified the wetland delineation.  The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 11 sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicates that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or informati on brought forth in the coordination process is of a significant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA.

The applicant utilized the Galveston District Interim Hydrogeomorphic functional analysis to determine the compensatory mitigation amounts.  The applicant’s Mitigation Plan is enclosed  in, Attachment B, in 245 sheets.   The applicant stated as per the Corps 2013 Memorandum for Record, SWG Watershed Approach for Compensatory Mitigation in the Addicks and Barker Project Region, compensatory mitigation for impacts to aquatic resource funct ions within the Addicks & Barker Project Regional Watershed (ABPRW) should be located with the ABPRW in order to restore flood attenuation functions back to the region and watershed to decrease risks to the Addicks and Barker Reservoirs.  The applicant sta ted all of the project impacts are located within the ABPRW and therefore the compensatory mitigation should be located within the ABPRW.  The applicant stated the proposed PRM tract is within the ABPRW.              The applicant acknowledges that Greens Bayou Wetland Mitigation Bank, Mill Creek Mitigation Bank, and Tarkington Bayou Mitigation Bank are suitable mitigation  banking options in the vicinity of the project location.  As of the date of this notice  and as stated by the applicant, Greens Bayou Mit igation Bank is a private, single user mitigation bank, Mill Creek Mitigation Bank is sold out of credits, and Tarkington Bayou does not have enough forested wetlands credits for the proposed project impacts.   CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site is a partially developed 4,954 -acre tract located on the Katy Prairie situated west of and adjacent to State Highway 99 and west of the existing Bridgeland Master Planned Community.

It is also to solicit your comments and information to better enable us to make a reasonable decision on factors affecting the public interest.   SCOPING : The Corps published a notice of intent an d initiated the scoping process in the Federal Register  to notify the public of the intent to prepare a DEIS on April 7, 2020. A meeting invitation was emailed to federal and state agencies for a virtual agency scoping meeting on May 14, 2020. Notices to interested parties and local, state, and federal elected officials were sent via email and mail on May 27 and May 28, 2020, respectively. The notices provid ed information about the proposed Action, announ ced the virtual public  scoping  meetings scheduled for June 9, June 11, June 16, and June 18,  2020, and provid ed a link to the Project website. Due to technical issues associated with the virtual meeting platform  during the June 9, 2020, virtual public scoping meeting , the format was chang ed and a n additional virtual public scoping meeting was scheduled for June 15, 2022, for a  total of five scoping meetings. The Corps solicited comments on the proposed Action during the scoping period meetings from the public, federal, state, and local age ncies and officials, Native American tribal groups, and other interested parties for the proposed permit activity.   BACKGROUND:  The Corps  received a permit application for a Department of the Army (DA) Permit pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and Section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act from the Port of  Corpus Christi Authority (PCCA) (SWG -2019 -00067) for the deepening of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel (proposed Action ). The Corps is the lead Federal agency under  the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the President’s Council on Environmental Q uality regulations and has prepare d an EIS for the proposed Action . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard  are cooperating agencies under NEPA . The DA permit application was first publicized by an extended Public Notice issued on August  1, 2019 .  Special Public Notice: SWG -2019 -00067  2 The PCCA  Channel Deepening Project  (CDP)  is located at Port Aransas, Nueces County, Texas . The CDP channel alignment is within the existing channel bottom of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel ( CCSC ) starting at Station 110+00 near the southeast side of Harbor Island. The CDP traverses easterly thr ough Aransas Pass and extends beyond the currently authorized terminus at Station –330+00. The CDP extension terminates at an additional 29,000 feet into the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) at Station –620+00, the channel’s proposed new terminus. The approximate dis tance of the proposed PCCA CDP is 13.8 miles. The Federal navigation channel segments from Stations 110+00 to –72+50 (Jetties Channel’s seaward limits) is currently authorized at -54 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). The Federal navigation channel segments  from –72+50 to –330+00 (Offshore Channel’s seaward limits) is currently authorized at -56 feet MLLW. For these segments, the Federally authorized channel bottom widths vary from 530 feet (inshore segments) to 700 feet (offshore segments).   The proposed A ction would deepen the channel from its current authorized depth of –54 feet MLLW from Station 110+00 to Station –72+50 to –75 feet MLLW. From Station -72+50 to Station –330+00, the channel would be deepened from –54 feet MLLW to –77 feet MLLW. The propose d project includes a 29,000 -foot extension of the CCSC from Station –330+00 to Station –620+00 and would be deepened to –77 feet MLLW. Two feet of advanced maintenance and 2 feet of allowable over dredge  would be applied to each CDP channel segment.  The pro posed Action  would span approximately 13.8 miles from a location near the southeast side of Harbor Island to the –80-foot MLLW bathymetric contour in the Gulf. The proposed Action  footprint would cover 1,778 acres, generating 46.3 million cubic yards of ne w work dredged material.   PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT : Based on public comments to date, the USACE has provided copies of additional reports that were incorporated by reference in the DEIS, but not included in the Appendices.  These additional documents are provided on the project website at:   www.swg.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/Special -Projects -Environmental -Impact -Statements.aspx   SOLICITATION OF COMMENTS:  The Corps is soliciting comments from the public, Federal, State, and local agencies and officials, Indian tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be consider ed by the Corps to determine whether to issue, modify, condition , or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and t he other public interest factors.   Comments received will be considered by the Corps to assist in determining whether to issue, modify, condition, or deny a permit for the proposed Action. Comments will be considered in the Final Environmental Impact Statement analysis pursuant to NEPA. All comments must be received or postmarked by Tuesday August 9 , 2022 .

MITIGATION:  No mitigation is proposed since the project would result in the restoration of natural hydrology in the project area that would benefit fisheries important to the Gulf region and provide enhanced foraging habitat for waterfowl, shorebirds, and wading birds .  CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The Bahia Grande Unit of the LANWR is a coastal ecosystem estua ry and wetland complex that consists of three shallow water basins – Bahia Grande, Laguna Larga, and Little Laguna Madre. The unit is located at the southernmost tip of Texas between the towns of Laguna Vista and Brownsville, Texas and is currently bounded by State Highway (SH) 100 to the north and the Brownsville Ship Channel and SH -48 to the southeast. Construction of these roadways and the ship channel in the early to mid- 1990s cut off the basins from their natural systems and significantly altered the overall hydrology of the area. High temperatures and the low and sometimes episodic rainfall patterns of the area have caused the basins to experience extreme high salinity. These developments ultimately resulted in severely degraded habitat with limited resources for fisheries and wildlife.

This project proposes modifications to Magnolia Creek, Cedar Gully, and three existing detention basins.   The tributaries will be regraded and resized to accommodate for NOAA Atlas 14 rainfall data.   The resizing will help ensure that drainage into the system from residential s ubdivisions (Westover Park, Countryside, Magnolia Creek, Rustic Oaks, and Jensen Colony) is meeting design standards and does not result in structural flooding within the neighborhoods.  De-snagging of the waterways will also occur with this work.   Another  aspect of the project is correcting failed erosion control structures and stabilizing side -slopes .  These corrections will increase long -term channel stability , reduce long -term maintenance costs, and maintain flood control function of the channels .  The project will modify stormwater outlets in the Magnolia Creek Subdivision to improve conveyance to the channel.   The existing culvert at the         Summer Place crossing of Magnolia Creek will also be modified into a staged culvert opening by placing m ultiple barrels at different elevations .  The project proposes impacts to a detention basin.    AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  The applicant has stated that they have avoided and minimized  the environmental impacts by avoiding impacts to 4,778 linear feet        (1.18 acres) of streams, 7.53 acres of emergent wetlands, and 21.46 acres of open water features .   MITIGATION:   The applicant has stated that the project will restore the original flow regime within Magnolia Cr eek and Cedar Gully resulting in a net gain of stream function and value s.  Therefore, no additional compensatory mitigation has been proposed for this project.    CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  The project site  is a suburban area with multiple residential subdivisions, some commercial properties and typical drainage features built over the last 40 years, with the majority of the residential construction occurring within the last 20 years.  The drainage channels are a combination of straightened, rerouted unnamed tributaries, and drainage ways constructed through uplands.  The drainage system also includes detention/retention basins.

The credits will be purchased from the TBMB, as well.     CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS :  Currently, the project area consists of maintained      right-of-way with forested margins.   Aerial imagery indicates land cover adjacent to the project area was mostly undeveloped forest in 1995; however, has since decreased in forested cover due to residential, commercial, or agricultural land use in the present day.  Based on the histor ical ecological descriptions and a high -level comparison of              aerial imagery, it is anticipated that vegetation communities within the project area are likely to consist of mixed communities of both native and introduced species which may or may not coincide  with past ecological descriptions of this region.   NOTES:   This public notice is being issued based on information furnished by the applicant.  This project information has not been verified by the Corps.  As of the date of this public notice, the Corps has received but not yet verified the wetland delineation.  The applicant’s plans are enclosed in 24 sheets.   A preliminary review of this application indicate s that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required.  Since permit assessment is a continuing process, this        preliminary determination of EIS requirement will be changed if data or information brought forth in the coordination process is of a sig nificant nature.   Our evaluation will also follow the guidelines published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 404 (b)(1) of the CWA .  OTHER AGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS:     The project site is not located within the Texas Coastal Zone and therefore, does not require certification from the Texas Coastal Management Program .  The proposed project will trigger review under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality  (TCEQ) will review this application under Section 401 of the CWA and in accordance with Title 30, Texas Administrative Code Section 279.1 -13 to determine if the work would comply with State water quality standards.   The applicant cont acted  the TCEQ  and initiated the Section 401 CWA process  and submitted a pre -filing meeting request, on 26 May 2022 .

LEAD FEDERAL AGENCY:     TxDOT has been identified as the lead federal agency for complying with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act .  As such, please direct all comments, questions, or concerns regarding these Acts to  TxDOT .    NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES:   The staff  archaeologist has reviewed the latest published version of the National Register of Historic Places, lists of properties determined eligible, and other sources of information.  The following is current knowledge of the presence or absence of historic prop erties and the effects of the undertaking upon these properties:    The majority of the permit areas are confined to an existing right -of-way (ROW) that has been extensively impacted by previous project activities and the portions of the permit areas outsi de the existing ROW have been impacted by residential and commercial development that there is no potential for historic properties to exist within them.  Therefore, the proposed project has no potential to effect historic properties .   Additionally, i n acc ordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), TxDOT as the lead federal  agency, evaluated the potential for the proposed project to affect properties listed, or eligible for listing, in the  National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  TxDOT conducted background reviews and field surveys for both  non-archeological historic resources and archeological resources within the project area, excluding the two  proposed detention basin areas.  None of the documented archeological resources  are recommended eligible for  the NRHP; therefore, it was determined that the proposed project will have no adverse effect on historic  properties or cultural resources.   TxDOT’s historic properties documentation was cleared as of              20 April 2017 .   THREATENE D AND ENDANGERED SPECIES :  Preliminary indications are that no known threatened and/or endangered species or their critical habitat will be affected by the proposed work.

MITIGATION: Approximately 0.38 -acre ofPFO wetlands w ill be converted to an emergent wetland type, and approximately 1.63 -acres of PFO wetlands and 0.003 -acre of PEM wetlands will have a permanent loss of wetland functions due to deposition of fill material and excavation during construction of the substation, detention pond, access road, and for pole installation at the preferred option location. Conversion impacts to PFO wetlands will result from clearing and grubbing activities within 100 -feet of the substation for storm resilience. The temporary impacts to other waters from access road culvert installation and clearing and grubbing activities will equate to 0.03 -acre. Loss of functions to other waters are not anticipated from culvert installation.The temporary workspace within the existing transm ission line cut -in will impact 0.19 -acre ofPEM wetlandsand will be returned to pre -construction contours and restored by natural revegetationupon completion of construction activities. The restored area will bemonitored during construction and restorat ion will be documented to determinesuccess of natural re -vegetation (i.e., regrowth of previously existing grasses andshrubs based on the existing seed source at the site). In-kind credits are available at Tarkington Bayou MitigationBank (TBMB). TBMB i s located inside the primary service area of the East ForkSan Jacinto River HUC. Entergy will be requesting approval to purchase wetlandcredits from TBMB for compensatory in-kind mitigation credits for unavoidableloss and conversion of wetland functionsto PFO wetlands for placement of theproposed substation, detention pond, and access road.This credit purchase shouldsatisfy the mitigation needs under the in -kind wetland approach for PFO impacts. Upon USACE approval, the applicantproposes a mitigatio n bank credit purchase witha 1.0 credit multiplier to offset losses to the following: • PFO Wetlands:temporarystorage of surface water (TSSW ) (physical ) – 0.8 functional capacity units ( FCUs ), maintenance of plant and animal communities (MPAC ) (biological ) – 1.4 FCUs,removal andsequestration of elements and compounds(RSEC ) (chemical ) – 0.9 FC Us.• Entergy proposes to purchase 1.4 -TSSW, 1.4 -MPAC, and 1.4 -RSEC FCUs from the TBMB to satisfy mit igation measures which includes loss andconversion of wetland functions from placement of the substation, detentionpond, and access road. • Entergy is not proposing to mitigate for permanent loss of wetland functionswithin PEMwetlands (pole installati on) since the loss will be less than 1/10of an acre (0.003 -acres). • Entergy is not proposing to mitigate for temporary impacts to PEMwetlands and other waters.",[None],,"[""ERROR: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'""]",,['95.1325297'],['30.3291145'],,,"[('2.23', 'and 133 -ft  water', None), ('1.63', 'palustrine forested wetland', 'permanent'), ('0.003', 'palustrine emergent wetland', None), ('0.38', 'PFO wetland', 'permanent'), ('0.03', '(133 -linear -feet)  water', None)]",[],"    Public Notice   U.S. Army Corps  Permit Application No:   SWG -2022 -00346  Of Engineers  Date Issued:   9 June 2022  Galveston  District  Comments Due:   11 July 2022      U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, GALVESTON DISTRICT    PURPOSE OF PUBLIC NOTICE:   To inform you of a proposal for work in which you might be interested.

The project can be located on the U.S.G.S. quadrangle map titled:  Fostoria, Texas .    LATITUDE & LONGITUDE (NAD 83):  Latitude:   30.3291145° North;  Longitude:   095.1325297° West      PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The applicant proposes to discharge approximately 11,136.97 -cubic yards of fill into approximately 2.23 -acres and 133 -ft of waters associated with the installation of an approximate 360 -foot x 310-foot new electrical substation, an approximate 2,195 -foot x 25 -foot access road, an approximate 215 -foot x 52 -foot detention pond, and an approximate 455 -foot x 733 -foot transmission line cut -in.  Such activities include permanent impacts (loss) to approximately 1.63 -acres of             palustrine forested wetlands (PFO), 0.003 -acre of palustrine emergent wetlands (PEM), and the permanent conversion of 0.38 -acre of PFO wetlands to PE M wetlands.  Temporary impacts include 0.19 -acre of PEM wetlands, and 0.03 -acre (133 -linear -feet) of waters associated with temporary workspaces .   AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION :  Avoidance and minimization efforts associated with the proposed project include minimization of impacts , as well as  reducing or eliminating the impact over time through  maintenance operations.  Impacts have been  minimized primarily through preferred substation location site selection.   Implementation of             best management practices (BMPs) during construction will reduce noise, dust emissions, and erosion, as well  as minimize adverse effects to the human and natural environment.   The applicant  stated that t he proposed access road and substation footprint has been minimized to the fullest exte nt practicable in order to reduce impacts to           PFO wetlands.  Additionally, the proposed substation will be located adjacent to an existing transmission line  right-of-way (ROW ) to reduce fragmentation of existing  forested habitat.   No secondary impacts to downstream flows, hydrology, or water quality are anticipated as a result of the proposed project.   Entergy will prepare a                       Storm Water  Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and obtai n a Notice of Intent for        storm  water  discharges from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).  The SWPP Plan will identify potential sources of pollution, which may reasonably be  expected to affect the quality of storm water runoff from construc tion of the site.

It is also to solicit your comments and information to better enable us to make a reasonable decision on factors affecting the public interest.   SCOPING: The Corps published a notice of intent and initiated the scoping process in the Federal Register  to notify the public of the intent to prepare a DEIS on April 7, 2020. A me eting invitation was emailed to federal and state agencies for  a virtual agency scoping meeting on May 14, 2020. Notices to interested parties and local, state, and federal elected officials were sent via email and mail on May 27 and May 28, 2020, respectively. The notices provided information about the proposed Action, announced the virtual public  scoping meetings scheduled for June 9, June 11, June 16, and June 18,  2020, and provided a link to the Project website. Due to technical issues associated with the virtual meeting platform  during the June 9, 2020, virtual public scoping meeting, the format was changed and an additional virtual public scoping meeting was scheduled for June 15, 2022, for a total of five scoping meetings. The Corps solicited comments on the proposed Action during the scoping period meetings from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Native American tribal groups, and other interested parties for the proposed permit activity.   BACKGROUND:  The Corps  received a permit application for a Department of the Army (DA) Permit pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and Section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act from the Port of  Corpus Christi Authority (PCCA) (SWG -2019-00067) for the deepening of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel (proposed Action). The Corps is the lead Federal agency under  the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the President’s Council on Environmental Quality regulations and has  prepared an EIS for the proposed Action. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard a re cooperating agencies under NEPA. The DA permit application was first publicized by an extended Public Notice issued on August  1, 2019.  Special Public Notice: SWG -2019- 00067 2 The PCCA  Channel Deepening Project  (CDP) is located at Port Aransas, Nueces County, Texas . The CDP channel alignment is within the existing channel bottom of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel ( CCSC) starting at Station 110+00 near the southeast side of Harbor Island. The CDP traverses easterly through Aransas Pass and extends beyond the currently authorized terminus at Station –330+00. The CDP extension terminates at an additional 29,000 feet into the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) at Station –620+00, the channel’s proposed new terminus. The approximate dis tance of the proposed PCCA CDP is 13.8 miles. The Federal navigation channel segments from Stations 110+00 to –72+50 (Jetties Channel’s seaward limits) is currently authorized at -54 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). The Federal navigation channel segments  from –72+50 to – 330+00 (Offshore Channel’s seaward limits) is currently authorized at -56 feet MLLW. For these segments, the Federally authorized channel bottom widths vary from 530 feet (inshore segments) to 700 feet (offshore segments).   The proposed A ction would deepen the channel from its current authorized depth of –54 feet MLLW from Station 110+00 to Station –72+50 to –75 feet MLLW. From Station -72+50 to Station –330+00, the channel would be deepened from –54 feet MLLW to –77 feet MLLW. The proposed project includes a 29,000-foot extension of the CCSC from Station– 330+00 to Station –620+00 and would be deepened to – 77 feet MLLW. Two feet of advanced maintenance and 2 feet of allowable over dredge would be applied to each CDP channel segment.  The proposed Action would span approximately 13.8 miles from a location near the southeast side of Harbor Island to the – 80-foot MLLW bathymetric contour in the Gulf. The proposed Action footprint would cover 1,778 acres, generating 46.3 million cubic yards of new work dredged material.
