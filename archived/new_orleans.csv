CP2 LNG Terminal Facilities  The Terminal Facilities will be constructed on 785.5 acres.  Five existing storage yards (including four marine yards on Calcasieu Pass) close to the Terminal Facilities will support construction.  These yards comprise an additional 38.3 acres.    The Terminal Site will affect 631.7 acres and will include pretreatment, liquefaction, power generation, storage, and support facilities. The Marine Facilities will occupy 122.2 acres on the southwest shorel ine of Monkey Island, which is located between the Calcasieu Ship Channel and Calcasieu Pass.  The Marine Facilities will include two LNG carrier loading docks, an excavated/dredged berthing area, and land- based support facilities.  Three 1.0- mile-long, 42- inch outside diameter LNG transfer pipelines, a boil -off gas pipeline, and associated utilities will run underground within a 31.6- acre temporary construction corridor between the Terminal Site and Marine Facilities.   At the Terminal Site, approximately 327.9 acres of wetlands will be impacted, including 286.3 acres of palustrine emergent (PEM) wetland, 32.1 acres of palustrine scrub- shrub (PSS) wetland, 1.7 acres of palustrine forested (PFO) wetland, and 7.8 acres of estuarine intertidal emergent (E2EM) wetland (also categorized as essential fish habitat [EFH]).  Of the 327.9 impacted wetland acres, 314.8 acres will be permanently impacted, 0.7 acre will be subject to extended temporary impacts (lasting for the full dur ation of Project construction), and 12.4 acres will be subject to short -term temporary impacts.  Approximately 4.2 acres of open waters will be permanently impacted and 1.0 acre will be temporarily impacted.    At the Marine Facilities on Monkey Island, approximately 41.2 acres of wetlands will be permanently impacted, including 13.8 acres of PEM wetland, 12.6 acres of PSS wetland, 0.6 acre of PFO wetland, and 14.2 acres of E2EM wetland.  Of the 14.2 acres of E2EM wetland, 12.5 shoreline acres within the dr edge prism will be converted to open water and 1.7 acres will be permanently filled for onshore facility construction.  The E2EM wetland is categorized as EFH, along with 19.4 acres of tidal waters within the dredge prism, the 0.3 acre of land- based open w aters that will be permanently removed, and the 0.2 acre of land- based open waters that will be converted to deep water.   During construction, a temporary 6.8- mile-long pipeline will transport dredged material from the Marine Facilities to a marsh creation/restoration site located at Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge (CPNWR). The pipeline will temporarily impact approximately 15.0 acres of PEM wetlands and 0.1 acre of PSS wetlands.      3  Pipeline System   CP Express will construct approximately 85.4 m iles of 48- inch-diameter underground natural gas pipeline (CP Express Pipeline), 6.0 miles of 24- inch-diameter underground lateral pipeline (Enable Gulf Run Lateral), and associated aboveground facilities, all in Texas and Louisiana.

The Sponsor has prepared this Prospectus in accordance with 33 CFR § 332.8(d)(2) . The purpose of MCMB  is to compensate for unavoidable impacts to Waters of the United States, including wetlands that result from activities authorized by the Department of the Army pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.   MCMB  is currently comprised of Cattle Pasture, Managed Timber Plantation, Fresh Water Marsh,  Cypress Swamp, Managed Pine Plantation, and Chinese Tallow Forest  habitats . (Attachment A  Figure 15). MCMB  has the potential to be restored to bottomland hardwoods (BLH) , cypress swamp (CS) , and freshwater marsh (FM)  habitats  through the implementation of re -establishment, rehabilitation, enhancement , and preservation Mitigation Types as defined in the CEMVN Louisiana Wetland Rapid Assessment Method Version 2.0 (LRAM) and the LRAM Version 2.0 Exce l Worksheet . The Sponsor will restore 90.1 acres to BLH wetlands , 75.8 acres to CS wetlands,  and 11.4 acres to upland s and also preserve  17.5 acres of FM wetlands, and 305.2 acres of CS wetlands for a total of 500.0  acres ( Attachment B  LRAMs BLH , FM, and CS ; Attachment A  Figure 16; and  Table 1). MCMB  will have long -term protection through financial assurances with long -term escrow accounts and the institution of a conservation servitude.   1.1 Site Location  The property is located approximately 14.7 miles  south west of Ponchatoula , Louisiana  (Attachment A Figure 01). The center point of MCMB  is located at latitude 30.290331 º and longitude -90.618117 º in Livingston  Parish , Louisiana ( Attachment A Figure 02). The location includes all or portions of Sections 04 and 05  of Township 09 South, Range  06 East. MCMB  is in the Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 08090 203, East Louisiana Coastal  within the Lake Pontchartrain  Basin (Attachment A Figure 17) .  State and Federal jurisdictional boundaries that encompass MCMB  include the following  the Louisiana Office of Coastal Management (OCM) Deltaic Region of the Louisiana Coastal Zone, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) , Mississippi Delta Cotton and Feed Grains Land Resource Region (LRR O) . The MCMB  also lies in the Environmenta l Protection Agency (EPA) designated Mississippi Alluvial Plain (73) Level III Ecoregion , and the Inland Swamps (73n)  Level IV Ecoregion. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agenc y (FEMA) , portions of MCMB  are within the 100 -year flood zone.  1.2 Driving Directions  From  I-55 in Ponchatoula,  head West  on LA -22 W for 5.2 miles  toward Springfield.  Turn left onto Main Street, continuing for 0.4 Miles. Turn right onto LA -22 W and continue for 11.7 miles to Martin Rd.  Turn left onto Martin Rd., the property will be located on the left.     Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   2  2.0 PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES   The goal of MCMB  is the cumulative re -establishment of 5.5 acres of bottomland hardwood (BLH), the rehabilitation of 84.6 acres of BLH and 75.8 acres of CS, the  preservation of 305.2 acres of CS , the preservation of 17. 5 acres of FM,  and the restoration of 1 1.4 acres of upland i n the Lake Pontchartrain  watershed  (HUC 08090203 ). The total acreage of MCMB  is 500.0 . The current and proposed habitat types, proposed mitigation types, and acreage are listed in Table 1  & Attachment A  Figure s 16.   The objectives of the Bank are diverse. MCMB  is well situated in the Lake Pontchartrain  Basin  and is capable of restoring and improving a range  of physical, hydrological, biogeochemical, biotic, and atmospheric functions to the watershed . These objectives are as follows    • Re-establish the current Dirt Logging Road and portions of the Managed Timber Plantation by re moving planted pine and eliminating Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera) then reforesting back to a native pine -hardwood flatwood forested wetland (BLH).  Restoring wetland vegetation will positively affect the physical structure of the area and restore wetla nd biogeochemical processes in the soil considerably via additional plant and invertebrate detritus.   • Rehabilitate  current portions of Managed Pine Plantation and Managed Timber by removing planted pine and eliminating Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera)  then reforesting back to a native pine -hardwood flatwood forested wetland (BLH).    • Rehabilitate current portions of M anaged Pine Plantation and Chinese Tallow Forest  habitat to a native cypress swamp  wetland  through the reforestation of native species by first removing planted pine and eliminating Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) .   • Preserv e and protect existing fresh marsh  and cypress swamp by instituting a conservational servitude and a long -term protection plan.   • Restoring  the upland buffer by planting native pine -hardwood flatwood trees will preserve the topography of this area and reduce adverse impacts to wetland functions from adjacent development. Restoration will reduce these impacts by moderating stormwater runoff, stabilizing soil to prevent erosion, providing habitat for wetland associated species, reducing direct human impact/acces s to a wetland, and by filtering suspended solids, nutrients, and toxic substances. Restoring the site will provide improved biotic conditions and create habitat for a multitude of mammals, reptiles, insects, and  hundreds of species of migratory birds .   • Restoring MCMB 's natural vegetative habitats to institute reclamation of the organic material to the system 's soil, and filter sediment deposition runoff into  the Amite River and Lake Maurepas .  • Ensuring the quality of MCMB  habitat through annual vegetation  monitoring, noxious invasive species control, and adaptive management if necessary.   • Providing long -term protection through financial assurances with long -term escrow accounts and the institution of a conservation servitude.  Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   3   As defined by The Natural Com munities of Louisiana published in 2009 by the  Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) and the Louisiana Natural  Heritage program (LNHP) Pine-Hardwood Flatwoods is a natural mixed forest community indigenous to the western Florida parishes i n southeast Louisiana. This community occupies poorly drained flats, depressional areas and small drainages that lie in a mosaic with higher, non -wetland areas. Hardwoods usually dominate the forest composition, but spruce pine can dominate areas within th e stand.   As defined by The Natural Communities of Louisiana  published in 2009 by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) and the Louisiana Natural Heritage program (LNHP)  bald cypress ( Taxodium  distichum ) Swamps are forested, alluvial swamps growing on intermittently exposed soils. The soils are  inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater on a nearly permanent basis throughout the growing season except during periods of extreme drought. Bayous commonly intersect these wetlands. There is a low floristic diversity. Taxodium  distichum (bald cypress) is the dominant overstory species. Many aquatic food webs depend on the input of allochthonous material in the form of leaf litter or other organic debris that the wetland forest provides. Net primary productivity of swamp forests seems to be i ncreased by periodic flooding or increased water flow and decreased by slow water movement or stagnation.   As defined by The Natural Communities of Louisiana  published in 2009 by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) and the Louisiana N atural Heritage program (LNHP)  Freshwater Marsh  is normally located adjacent to Intermediate Marsh along the northern most extent of the coastal marshes, although it may occur beside coastal Bays where freshwater is entering the bay (e.g., Atchafalaya Bay ). Small pools or ponds may be scattered. The floristic composition of these sites is quite heterogeneous and is variable from site to site. Frequency and duration of flooding which are intimately related to microtopography seem to be the primary factors g overning species distributions. Substrate, current flow, salinity, competition, and allelopathy are also important in determining species distribution patterns. Freshwater Marsh has the greatest plant diversity and highest soil organic matter content of an y marsh type.  Wildlife populations are generally the highest  in this marsh type. Like the other marsh types, Freshwater Marsh acts as an important  nursery area for the young of many  aquatic species.

This section provides the  baseline/current site conditions on and adjacent to the proposed site.  3.1 Land Use  3.1.1  Historic Land Use  Prior t o hydrologic modifications by the European settlers, MCMB  was hydrologically  influenced by riverine flooding , meandering  from the Mississippi and Amite Rivers , rainfall, sheet flow, and the ebb and flow of tides.  It is believed t he original cypress and the pine -hardwood flatwoods forest were  first logged around  the turn of the 19th century . Timber sale documents from 1910 an d 1946 provide evidence  that some portions of the  property were harvested during the 1900 ’s. The 1952 historical aerial photograph shows a dense pine and oak habitat on the natural ridge surrounded by a vast cypress forest (Attachment A Figure 02A). In 1982 the pine -hardwood flatwoods forest and the cypress forest appear to be relatively unchanged since 1952  and the fresh marsh areas to the south are visible  (Attachment A Figure 02B).  Sometime between 1998  and 2000 the natural ridge  of the project area  started to be managed as a commercial pine plantation . The 2004 imagery depicts the majority of the  oaks and pine  on the natural ridge  have been  clear -cut and the current Managed Timber Plantation  within in the northwest corner of the project boundary appears to have been  selectivity cut (Attachment A Figure 02C). Following the harvest  in 2000 , the current Managed Pine Plantation and Managed Timber Plantation  was then sprayed with  herbicide, site prep , burned, and then hand planted using loblolly  pine ( Pinus taeda)  seedlings.  However , the northeast portion of the current Chinese Tallow Forest habitat was not planted  after this harvest . Because of the lack of competition , this area is now dominated by Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera) . This area was managed differently because it was  owned by a separate landowner at the time.  The 2009 imagery depicts the 2000 planted pine as the dominant tree species in the Managed Pine Plantation  and in the Managed Timber Plantation  (Attachment A Figure 02D). Field investigation reveals  the 2000 planted pine has not been thinned  as typically performed  to pine stands . It is assumed that the site 's wet conditions  and lack of markets for pi ne pulpwood in the local are the main reasons the pine stand has not had a first thinning timber operation performed on it.  Although the pine has not been thinned, there is evidence that the pine has been burned. Charred logs left over from prescribed burn s are found throughout the managed pine plantation.  Although  there  are few mid-story oak trees within the Managed Pine Plantation , some mature oaks species are present within the Managed Timber Plantation because th is area  was selectively harvested and not clear -cut. Because the current  Chinese tallow forest was clear -cut this area is now dominated by Chinese tallow . 3.1.2  Existing/Current Land Use  Currently, the following habitats occur within MCMB  0.4 acres of Cattle Pasture , 9.8 acres of Managed Timber Plantation , 17.5 acres of Fresh Water Marsh , 305. 2 acres of Cypress Swamp , 66.3 acres of Managed Pine Plantation , and 99.1 acres of Chinese Tallow Forest . (Attachment A  Figures 02F and Figure 15) . The land use surrounding a one -mile radius of MCMB  consists of 4944.9  acres of the following land use types 1.8 acres of Developed High Intensity land, 74.8 ac res of Developed Low Intensity land, 19.6 acres of Developed Medium Intensity land, 46.9 acres of Developed Open Space land, 555.3 acres of Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   6  Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands, 29.7 acres of Evergreen Forest, 4.4 acres of Grasslands/Herbaceous land, 4.4 acres of Mixed Forest, 141.7 acres of Open Water, 80.2 acres of Pasture/Hay land, 2.4 acres of Shrub/Scrub land, and 3983.7 acres of Woody Wetlands. This one -mile radius also includes protected land located within the High Point Mitigation Bank and the Maurepas Wil dlife Management Area  (Attachment A Figure 4).   3.2 Soils  According to Soil Survey of Livingston Parish Louisiana  (1984)  and USDA Web Soil Survey of the subject property, the following soils are found to occur   • Barbary muck 0 to 1 percent slopes (B A). The Barbary series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in recent, slightly fluid to very fluid clayey sediments that have been deposited in water and are continuously saturated and flooded. These soil s are mainly on low, broad, ponded backswamps of the lower Mississippi River Alluvial Plain. Slope is less than 1 percent.   • Colyell  silt loam 0 to 1 percent slopes (C o). This component is on stream terraces, fluviomarine terraces. The parent material consi sts of thin silty loess over late pleistocene silty and clayey fluviomarine deposits over late pleistocene silty and clayey marine deposits. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.    • Colyell Springfield Silt Loam  (Cy). The Colyell component is on stream terraces, fluviomarine terraces. The parent material consists of thin silty loess over late pleistocene silty and clay ey fluviomarine deposits over late pleistocene silty and clayey marine deposits. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained. Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.  The Springfield component makes up 25 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. This component is on terraces on river valleys. The parent material consists of loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained. Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.

Portions of nine parishes lie within the Basin Ascension, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Tammany, and Livingston. The Basin is divided into six distinct areas the upper, middle, lower, an d Pearl basins, and the Lake Maurepas/Pontchartrain and Lake Pontchartrain/Borgne land bridges . The major hydrologic features of the Basin are Lakes Maurepas, Pontchartrain,  Borgne, and Chandeleur  Sound. Lake Pontchartrain is connected to Lake Maurepas to the west and Lake Borgne to the east by passes through interlaying  land bridges. The Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (IHNC) and the MRGO provide a direct link between Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf  of Mexico . Currently f resh water enters the Basin through leaks in the Bonnet Carr Spillway, through the IHNC Lock, the Violet Siphon, numerous small rivers and bayous (totaling approximately 9,500 cfs), and from direct rainfall. Urban stormwater discharg es from the New Orleans metropolitan area also enter Lake Pontchartrain (The Pontchartrain Basin CWPPRA)  (Attachment A Figures 10 and 10A) .  Livingston Parish has a humid, subtropical, marine climate. Livingston Parish 's average annual total precipitatio n is about 64 inches. Of this, about 34 inches, or 53 percent, usually falls in April through September. In winter, the average temperature is 51°F, and the average daily minimum temperature is 40°F. In summer, the average temperature is 81°F and the avera ge daily maximum temperature is 92°F. The sun shines 70 percent of the time in summer and 50 percent in winter (Soil Survey of Livingston Parish) . Watershed sources include direct precipitation, surface runoff, high water tables, and tidal flooding . 3.3.2  Histor ic Hydrology and Drainage Patterns   The Pontchartrain  basin  complex was  formed by Mississippi River deposits between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago (Frazier 1967).  Historically, freshwater entered the Pontchartrain Basin through Bayou Manchac (until its closure  in 1812) and from natural crevasses from the Mississippi River (until the construction of the Mississippi River levees in the 1930s)  (The Pontchartrain Basin CWPPRA).  Historically , the hydrological influences of MCMB  were the freshwater  inputs from the Mississippi and Amite rivers, backwater flooding, direct precipitation,  and high-water  tables . 3.3.3  Existing/Current Hydrology and Drainage Patterns    MCMB topography is generally flat , with a natural ridge running through the center of the property. A gradual slope runs  eastward from the natural ridge, which eventually flattens to a floodplain. Elevations derived from state -sponsored LIDAR data range from 0.0 ' to 8.0' relative to the NA VD88 datum, with elevations between 0 ' and 6 ' within the proposed wetland areas (Attachment A Figure 07). Currently , there are 15. 2 acres over the 5 ' contour within the MCMB boundary  (Attachment A Figure 08) .  Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   8  Although the vegetated habitat of MCMB has been significantly altered, the topography of MCMB has remained natural. The primary hydrological feature of the Managed Pine Plantation, Managed Timber Plantation, and Chinese Tallow Forest are precipitation, sheet flow, high water tables , and occasio nally tidal flooding. The primary hydrological features of the Cypress Forest are surface runoff from neighboring ridges, precipitation, sheet flow, tidal flooding, and ebb and flow of the Pontchartrain Basin. These areas currently function as a wetland an d have no manmade or natural hydrological hinderance. Excess waters from the natural ridge sheet flow down gradient form the top of the natural ridges towards the surrounding Cypress Forest. Water then slowly moves west through the surrounding cypress fore st toward Lake Maurepas into the greater Pontchartrain basin. (Attachment A Figure 13).  3.3.4  Jurisdictional Wetlands  The Sponsor conducted a wetland delineation of the property that includes MCMB , which was submitted for approval by the  CEMVN as a preliminary  jurisdictional determination  (PJD)  MVN -2023 -00280 on December  12, 2022 (Attachment A Figure 18 ). The Sponsor is awaiting a reference number, and approval of said PJD, at this time. The wetland delineation includes additional acreage  not within the proposed MCMB  boundary.  CEMVN has not yet made a preliminary jurisdictional determination on the recently  sent wetland delineation . The wetland delineation reveal s the MCMB boundary contains approximately  483.0 acres of wetlands  and 17.0 acres of uplands (Attachment A  Figure  18). 3.4 Vegetation  3.4.1  Historic Plant Community  Historic plant communities for MCMB are b ased on comparison to reference sites with similar soil, geology,  topography,  and potentially similar historical/current habitat type, such as  the adjacent  High Point  Mitigation Bank  and Maurepas Swamp WMA (Attachment A Figures 19). According to the Natur al Communities of Louisiana (LDWF 2009) , prior to use as a Loblolly pine plantation,  MCMB  would have likely consisted of  Pine-hardwood flatwoods ( bottomland hardwood s) and cypress swamp habitats.  USFWS lists five different NWI habitat classifications within the Project Area  palustrine forested broad -leaved deciduous temporary flooded  (PFO1 A), palustrine forested Needle -Leaved Evergreen  temporarily  flooded  (PFO 4A), palustrine forested needle -leaved deciduous /broad -leaved deciduous semi permanently (PFO2/1F) , palustrine forested broad -leaved deciduous /Needle -Leaved Evergreen temporarily flooded  (PFO1/4A),  and palustrine emergent  persistent  semi permanently  flooded  (PEM1F ) (Attachment A  Figure 11). 3.4.2  Existing Plant Co mmunity  Multiple habitats  were found to occur at MCMB . Habitat investigations and data from the Sponsor -performed wetland delineation revealed the following habitats at MCMB  (Attachment A  Figure 15).   The area defined as ""Cattle Pasture "" was observed to have non -wet conditions. This area is currently  being heavily  managed for cattle  grazing . Dominant vegetative species observed within the herb stratum include  ryegrass  (Lolium perenne L. ), FACU .  The area defined as ""Dirt Logging Road "" was observed to have non -wet conditions. This road remains a remnant of past logging activities  in the area. Dominant vegetative species observed within the herb stratum include carex species (Carex spp.), bermudagrass Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   9  (Cynodon dactylon) FACU, lamp rush ( Juncus effusus) FACW, and basketgrass (Oplismenus hirtellus) FAC.   The area defined as ""Managed Pine Plantation "" was observed to have some non -wet conditions in higher elevations and mostly wet conditions in lower elevation areas. This area was clear -cut for timber in 2000. Following the harvest, this area was then sprayed with herbicide, site prep, burned, and then hand planted in rows using loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda) seedlings. Due to timber management , this area is primarily a loblolly pine monocultur e as the tree stratum exceeds 95% relative cover of loblolly  species with little to no mid -story oak trees. Chinese tallow trees are beginning to emerge in locations where trees were downed by Hurricane Ida in 2021. Dominant vegetative species observed within the tree stratum include loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ), FAC;  spruce pine ( Pinus glabra) , FACW;  and Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera) , FAC . Dominant vegetative species observed within the herb stratum include dwarf palmetto ( Sabal minor ), FACW; and frank's sedge ( Carex frankii ) OBL.     The area defined as ""Managed Timber Plantation "" was observed to have non -wet conditions in higher elevation and wet conditions in lower elevation areas. This area was selective harvested in 2004 . Therefore, more oak trees are  present in the canopy and mid -story than in the Managed Pine Plantation. This  habitat also contains areas  with over 5 5% absolute cover of Chinese tallow trees where mature trees were downed by Hurricane Ida in 2021. Dominant vegetative species observed within the tree stratum include loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ), FAC; Chinese tallo w (Triadica sebifera) , FAC; and water oak ( Quercus nigra)  FAC.  Dominant vegetative species observed within the shrub stratum include yaupon ( IIex vomitoria ), (FAC);  spruce pine ( Pinus glabra) , FAWC;  Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) , and  FAC; swamp chestnut oak ( Quercus michauxii ), (FACW).  Dominant vegetative species observed within the herb stratum include dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor ), FACW; and Raven -foot sedge ( Carex crus -corvi ) OBL.   The area defined as ""Chinese Tallow Forest "" was observed to h ave wet conditions and over 70% absolute cover of Chinese tallow trees. This area was clear -cut for timber in 2000. Areas adjacent to the Cypress Forest and the Managed Timber Plantation were planted with loblolly pine following the timber harvest. But bec ause of wetter conditions the loblolly pine in these specific areas did not establish, and Chinese tallow become the dominant tree species. The northeast portion of this area was not planted with loblolly pine after the timber harvest. Wetter conditions an d reduced competition after clear -cutting  allowed the  Chinese tallow to proliferate. Dominant vegetative species observed within the tree stratum include Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera), FAC and  sweetgum  (Liquidambar styraciflua ), FAC. Dominant vegetat ive species observed within the shrub stratum include Chinese tallow ( Triadica sebifera), FAC; spruce pine ( Pinus glabra) , FACW;  and loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ), FAC. Dominant vegetative species observed within the herb stratum include dwarf palmetto ( Sabal minor ), FACW; Raven -foot sedge ( Carex crus-corvi ) OBL; and  maiden -cane ( Panicum hemitomon), OBL.     The area defined as ""Fresh water Marsh "" was observed to have wet conditions . This habitat was observed to be a functioning freshwater marsh. Dominant vegetative species observed within the herb stratum include  giant cut grass ( Zizaniopsis miliacea ), OBL; cattail ( Typha latifolia ), OBL; green flatsedge ( Cyperus virens ), FACW;  and large-flower primrose -willow ( Ludwigia grandiflora ), OBL .  The area defined as ""Cypress Swamp "" was observed to have wet conditions.  The habitat was observed to be a healthy and thriving cypress swamp  with an average  of 60 percent Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   10  canopy coverage . The hydrology  in this area is directly connected to the Gulf of Mexico tidal flux via its connections to the Amite River  and Lake Maurepas . Dominant vegetative species observed within the tree stratum include  bald cypress ( Taxodium distichum ), OBL and red maple ( Acer rubrum var. drummondii ), FAC. Dominant vegetative species observed within the herb stratum include  lizard 's tail ( Saururus cernuus ), OBL; pickerelweed ( Pontederia cordata ), OBL; and cattail ( Typha latifolia ), OBL.   3.5 General Bank Nee d Through the reforestation of silviculture production land, management of invasive Chinese tallow trees, and planting of desirable vegetation, the proposed Bank is expected to provide, enhance,  and restore specific biogeochemical processes, including atte nuation, transformation, and storage of pollutants, ultimately returning the property into a naturally forested wetland. Wetland ecological benefits to the watershed from natural re-forestation include increased nesting, feeding, foraging, denning , and loa fing habitat functions for wetland and aquatic species through desirable canopy re -establishment and increased desirable native  wetland vegetative cover within the ground c over and shrub/sapling strata.  The preservation of the surrounding cypress forest and fresh marsh habitat will further protect this vital habitat.   The proposed MCMB  will directly address several identified needs, which include the following   Natural Communities of Louisiana (Louisian a Department of  Wildlife and Fisheries)  • Spruce Pine -Hardwood Flatwood o ccurs in a very narrow range in Livingston, East Baton Rouge and perhaps Ascension Parishes.  Presettlement  acreage is estimated at 50,000 to 100,000 acres with only 10 % currently remai ning.   The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection , and Restoration Act ( CWPPRA) Basin Plan  • Supporting short -term strategy is to consider site -specific, small -scale projects in all subbasins where there is a critical need for wetlands protection or restorat ion, or a significant opportunity for wetlands creation. In the short -term, demonstration and pilot projects must also be conducted to develop , or test methods and approaches needed for implementing long -term strategies.  • Achieving no net loss of wetlands in the Basin.   Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana  Louisiana 's Comprehensive  Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast (2017).  • Promote a sustainable coastal ecosystem by harnessing the natural processes of  the system.  • Providing a sustainable long -term solution for coastal protection and restoration.   The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program (the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Act of 2000; Clean Water Act, Section 121)  • To restore the ecological health of the Basin.   4.0 ESTA BLISHMENT OF THE MITIGATION BANK   This section describe s how the mitigation bank will be established, as stated in 33 CFR 332.8(d)(2) (ii); the technical feasibility of the proposed mitigation bank, as stated in 33 Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   11  CFR 332.8(d)(2) (iv); and the assurance of sufficient water rights to support the long -term susta inability of the mitigation bank, as stated in 33 CFR 332.8(d)(2)(vii)(A) . 4.1 Site Restoration Plan  This section provides information on the proposed soils , hydrologic , and vegetative work that was determined to be necessary for restoration , enhancement , and/or preservation of the proposed site .  This Bank will provide the cumulative re -establishment of 5.5 acres of BLH, the rehabilitation of 84.6 acres of BLH and 75.8 acres of CS, the preservation of 305.2 acres of CS  and 17. 5 acres of FM , and the restoration  of 11.4 acres of upland buffer in the  Lake Pontchartrain  watershed (HUC 08090 203). The current and proposed habitat types, proposed mitigation types, and acreage s are listed in Attachment A Table 1 & Attachment A Figures 15 & 16. In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Bank, and to meet all requirements stated in 33 CFR 332.8;  in summary, the Sponsor will remove planted pine and chemically control invasive species  throughout the property , chemically dispose of invasive tree species  within the Chinese Tallow Forest , allow for the natural recruitment of wet herbaceous plants, reforest historical BLH CS habitat,  preserve CS swamp  and FM habitats , and restore and maintain  upland  buffer habitat  along the western boundary . Also, the Spons or will implement effective short -term and long -term management strategies.  4.1.1  Soils/Hydrologic Work  First, the Remnant barbed wire fence will be removed to allow for uninhibited wildlife access. Also, the existing debris and trash will be removed from the mi tigation area.   Although the vegetation  habitat of MCMB has been significantly altered , the topography of MCMB has remained natural. MCMB 's restoration area s exhibit  hydric soils and wetland hydrology.  Therefore, no hydrological restoration or soil work is required  to sustain wetland functions at MCMB. The Sponsor anticipates no long -term structural management requirements will be needed to ensure sustained hydrology and wetland functions at MCMB  (Attachment A Figure s 12, 12A, 12B, 12C  and 14).   There are 15. 2 acres over the 5 ' contour within the MCMB boundary.  No dirt work or elevation change is required  to restore MCMB , and the proposed site  restoration will not change existing elevations at MCMB. After  restoration , MCMB will contain 1.7 acres of BLH re -establishment, 2.2 acres of BLH  rehabilitation, and 11.4 acres of upland restoration for a total of 15. 3 acres over  the 5 ' contour  (Attachment A Figure 08).  4.1.2  Vegetative Work  Over the course of the land 's conversion from its natural state to a managed pine plantation, timber plantation , and a Chinese tallow forest , modifications such as timber harvesting, pine plantings, burnings, and lack of invasive species control have drastically changed MCMB. To restore  this area 's natural habitat and meet the objectives of MCMB, timber management must be stopped, pine tree monoculture must be removed,  and invasive species must be eliminated  (Attachment A Figures 12, 12A, 12B,  and 12C).  To rehabilitate the current Managed Pine Plantation and Managed Timber Plantation, planted loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ) trees will be mechanically cut and hauled off -site to a timber mill. Trees downed by Hurricane Ida in 2021 will also be removed from the project area. Loblol ly stumps will remain to deteriorate naturally within the system. To preserve the existing desirable tree species, where appropriate, naturally occurring spruce pine Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   12  (Pinus glabra)  and desirable hard mast species  will not be harvested. Harvesting will occu r during the dry season to ensure ruts from mechanical equipment do not alter hydrology.  However, if ruts happen the Sponsor will utilize the existing soil to backfill to natural grade.   Rehabilitating the current Chinese Tallow Forest will require at leas t two herbicide treatments b efore the initial planting. First , existing Chinese tallow will be treated with herbicides  via the hack and squirt method and aerial spraying. Second, after the growing season following the initial herbicide treatment, any remai ning Chinese tallow trees will be treated with herbicides; treated trees will  be left  to deteriorate naturally within the system.  There is no vegetation work proposed within the Preservation Cypress Swamp or Freshwater Marsh   The restoration of MCMB  vegetative habitats is expected to institute the reclamation of the organic material to the system 's soil and to filter sediment deposition runoff into the surrounding watershed. Also, rebuilding BLH  and CS  habitats with native wetl and trees and emergent species will positively affect the physical structure of the area and will restore biogeochemical processes in the soil considerably via additional plant and invertebrate detritus.   Bottomland Hardwoods  The Sponsor intends to re -establish 5.5 acres BLH and rehabilitate 84.6 acres of BLH by conducting Pine-Hardwood Flatwood habitat tree plantings and allowing the natural recruitment of appropriate emergent tree  species within the mitigation areas (Attachment A Figure s 16 and 20). The Pine-Hardwood Flatwood  planting s will be conducted during the first planting season (December 15 to March 15) following the completion of all soil/hydrological work. Due to the exi sting forested conditions on site, the Sponsor is not anticipating the presence of a hard pan and  has not proposed the use of a subsoiling implement within the BLH mitigation areas. BLH mitigation type and Pine-Hardwood Flatwood  habitat locations and speci es composition were determined by analyzing lidar data, hydrolog ic data, soil data, LDWF Natural Communities of Louisiana, CRMS data , and species composition of reference sites. The composition of Pine-Hardwood Flatwood species chosen will match species to the closest extent possible to those on adjacent wetlands with similar soil types. Commercial Pine-Hardwood Flatwood  species will be chosen where appropriate to tolerate the same hydrological conditions as those on the adjacent lands and according to elevations on the proposed site (Attachment C BLH & UPR Species List ). All seedlings must be obtained from a registered, licensed Louisiana nursery grower. The contractor must obtain and provide to DNR/OCM certification fro m the contracting nursery that plant materials are of a Louisiana ecotype species and have been acclimated to Louisiana climatic and habitable conditions for at least 90 days prior to planting. Bare -root seedlings of mixed Pine-Hardwood Flatwood  species wi ll be planted within BLH re -establishment and rehabilitation tracts at approximately 9 ' X 9' spacing at a minimum initial stand density of 538 stems per acre (Attachment A Figure 12C).  Because of the anticipated natural recruitment of soft mast species, MCMB will be planted at a 7525 hard to soft mast ratio. Hard mast species within Pine-Hardwood Flatwood  areas shall comprise of no less than 60 percent or greater than 80 percent of seedlings overall. No individual species will represent more than 20 perce nt of the vegetative plantings .  Upland Restoration  The 11.4 acres of upland restoration buffer at MCMB  will be planted with seedlings of mixed BLH species, at approximately 9 ' X 9' spacing at a minimum initial stand density of 538 stems per acre (Attachment C BLH & UPR Species List).    Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   13  Cypress Swamp  (Rehabilitation)  The Sponsor intends to rehabilitate 75.8 acres of CS  by conducting tree plantings and allow ing the natural recruitment of appropriate emergent species within the mitigation areas.  There will be no planting s within  the preservation area (Attachment A Figure s 16 and 20). The CS planting will be conducted during the first planting season (December 15  to March 15) following the completion of all soil/hydrological work. Due to the existing forested conditions on site, the Sponsor is not anticipating the presence of a hard pan and has not proposed the use of a subsoiling implement within the CS mitigatio n areas. CS habitat locations and species composition were determined by analyzing lidar data, hydrology data, soil data, LDWF Natural Communities of Louisiana, CRMS data and species composition of reference sites. The composition of CS species chosen will  match species to the closest extent possible to those on adjacent wetlands with similar soil types. Commercial CS species were chosen to tolerate the same hydrological conditions as those on the adjacent lands and according to elevations on the proposed s ite (MWP Attachment C CS Species List). All seedlings will be obtained from a registered, licensed Louisiana nursery grower. The contractor must obtain, and provide to DNR/OCM, certification from the contracting nursery that plant materials are of a Louisiana ecotype species and have been acclimated to Louisiana climatic and habitable conditions for at least 90 days prior to planting. Seedlings of mixed CS species, where appropriate, will be planted at approximately 12 ' X 12' spacing at a minimum init ial stand density of 302 stems per acre  (Attachment A Figure 12C).   Cypress Swamp ( Preservation)  No vegetation work will be performed within this area .   Fresh Marsh  (Preservation)  No vegetation work will be performed within this area .  4.1.3  Invasive and Exotic Plant Control  The Sponsor intends to use  chemical  methods  to eliminate existing invasive/exotic vegetation present such as Chinese tallow (Triadica sebiferum ) at MCMB . This may include, but is not limited to, spray on application by hel icopter as well as hand spraying by ground field crews. Prior to planting, all Chinese tallow within and immediately surrounding the mitigation boundary will be chemically treated with herbicides and eliminated. The treated tree stems will be left in place  to deteriorate naturally within the system. If needed, aerial or ground application of annual/perennial grasses and broadleaf weed herbicides will be used to effectively reduce competition for planted seedlings in re -establishment and rehabilitation areas .  In addition, the Sponsor will control these undesirable/exotic species as part of the maintenance and monitoring plan.  Monitoring for exotic and invasive species will occur annually and control techniques will be implemented as needed to sustain long -term undesirable/exotic species  presence to 3 percent per acre or less. This may include, but is not limited to, spray on application by helicopter as well as hand spraying by ground field crews. As the Bank matures, monitoring will continue but exotic speci es control measures are expected to decline as a steady -state , self-perpetuating natural ecosystem is established. Funding will be available for any of the above stated maintenance until long-term success criteria are met.  Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   14  4.2 Technical Feasibility  The constructio n work required to develop the B ank is routine in nature and feasible. The mitigation activities involve primarily reforestation using bare -root seedlings. These activities have long been utilized in wetland restoration and mitigation projects and are proven methods. The Sponsor has the necessary funds and personnel to successfully implement the proposed vegetative plantings. A more specific examination of the technical restoration methods is presented in Section 4.0 of this Prospectus . 4.3 Current Site Risk  Currently  there are no right-of-way/servitudes , liens, or oil and gas leases within  the Bank boundary . In preparation for this project design the Sponsor has reviewed  a preliminary title. A title opinion and survey plat will be provided with the anticipated Draft MBI submittal.    All the l isted right -of-ways  (ROW)  below are adjacent to the MCMB  boundary. Please see Attachment A Figure 9 for easement  locations .   The ROW adjacent to MCMB, along Martin Road, is designated for a powerline. The power line belongs to Dixie Electric Company. This ROW is maintained by bush hogging and limb trimming typically once a year to prevent the growth of woody species.   This ROW also extends parallel with the MCMB boundary along the curve of Highway 22. The ROW will not negatively affect the hydrologic goals of MCMB. The topography within this ROW is currently at natural grade. The existing power lines  will not adversely affect  the success of MCMB.     East Ascension Telephone Company has a ROW running parallel to MCMB.  The ROW specifies that any phone lines must be constructed within 10  (ten) feet of the Highway 22 ROW.  The MCMB boundary has been offset approximately 15 (fifteen) fe et from the outside edge of this ROW to ensure there are no adverse effects from potential activities within the ROW.  This ROW will have no negative effects on the success of MCMB.    4.4 Long -Term Sustainability of the Site  Due to its location and project desi gn, the proposed Mitigation Bank has a very high likelihood of success. MCMB  will be restored to the types of communities that were historically present in the project area. Long -term viability and sustainability of MCMB  will be ensured through active annu al monitoring, adaptive management, invasive species control, and long -term maintenance. No weirs or structures will be required to maintain the MCMB  post-restoration hydrologic regime, so structural maintenance will not be an issue. Similarly, the relianc e on the system 's natural hydrology will ensure that the restored habitats are subject to a regionally appropriate , natural hydro -period. A long -term management plan will be included within the mitigation banking instrument . It will detail a long-term mana gement plan and the associated costs , as well as identify a funding mechanism in accordance with 33 CFR 332.7(d).   5.0 PROPOSED SERVICE AREA   Due to MCMB  location within the Lake Pontchartrain  Basin , the Sponsor  suggest s the primary service area  be the Lake Pontchartrain  Basin. The Lake Pontchartrain  Basin is made up of  the East Louisiana Coastal  (HUC  08090 203). This service area will provide offsets for unavoidable impacts to wetlands and ""Waters of the United States "". Use of Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   15  MCMB  beyond this area will be determined by the CEMVN on a case -by-case  basis  (Attachment A  Figure 17) .   6.0 OPERATION OF THE MITIGATION BANK   This section describes how the proposed Bank will be operated, as required by  33 CFR 332.8(d)(2) (ii), and provides deta ils on the proposed ownership arrangements and long -term management strategy for the mitigation bank, as required  by 33 CFR 332.8(d)(2) (v) . 6.1 Project Representatives  6.1.1  Sponsor and Operations Manager  JMB Partnership, LLC  203 Main Street  Franklin, Louisiana 70538  POC Aaron C.

JMB Partnership, LLC will serve as the mitigation service provider (Sponsor) and the long -term steward of MCMB . The implementation as a mitigation bank ( i.e., Conservation Servitude filing and implementation of the mitigation work plan) will be  completed by the Sponsor.  Maurepas Coastal  Mitigation Bank   16  6.4 Site Protection  Pursuant to the Louisiana Conservation Servitude Act, R.S. 91271 et seq., a perpetual conservation servitude will be placed on the 500.0 -acre MCMB . This servitude will be held by a conservation -oriented 501(c)(3) organization to be determined. The conserv ation servitude will be binding to and run with the title of the property. This conservation servitude will prohibit activities that would reduce the quality and quantity of the restored/enhanced wetlands, such as clear cutting, the discharge of fill, cons truction activities, cattle grazing , or other agricultural activities.   The servitude will also specify permissive activities such as hunting, fishing, recreational use, and mineral exploration given that the activity does not negatively affect the functio ns and values of the re-established, rehabilitated, enhanced, and preserved wetlands . 6.5 Long -Term Strategy  A long -term maintenance and protection escrow account will provide funding for long -term boundary maintenance and site protection in accordance with 33 CFR § 332.7 (d) into perpetuity. These long -term maintenance and site protection activities will be conducted by the Sponsor. The conservation easement will protect the site from any activities that would diminish the quality of restored  wetlands on the site. No structures are proposed or would be necessary to assure hydrologic or vegetative restoration.

332.8(d)(2). The proposed name of the mitigation bank is the East Bedico Creek Mitigation Bank (EBCMB). Pass On It Properties, LLC is the owner of all property encompassing the proposed EBCMB and will serve as the Sponsor assuming long-term management of the properties.  The contact information for the Sponsor/Owner is listed in Section 6.1.  The property currently supports cutover pine, cutover hardwoods, upland hardwoods, mature bottomland hardwoods (BLH), and agricultural ditches. The Sponsor proposes to re-establish, rehabilitate, and preserve a total of 1 26.8 acres of BLH within the EBCMB in accordance with the 2008 Final Rule “Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources,” Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers (33 CFR Parts 332), and with the guidance provided by the New Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on the Corps’ Regulatory In-lieu Fee and Bank Information Tracking System (RIBITS).  1.1 Site Location  The proposed EBCMB includes portions of two properties located along LA Highway 1077 approximately six miles northwest of Covington, in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana (Figure 1). The properties are located in all, or portions of, Section s 16, 17, 20, and 21, Township 06  South and Range 10  East. The geographic coordinates in decimal degrees are 30.51168, -90. 21257 for the west property and 30.51750, -90.20607 for the east property ( Figure 2).  Driving Directions  From New Orleans take Causeway Boulevard north for approximately 30 miles to the I-1 2 west exit.  Travel on I-1 2 west for approximately six miles and take exit 57 for LA Highway 1077 north. The EBCMB properties are located on both sides of LA Highway 1077, approximately four miles north of the I-12/LA Highway 1077 intersection.

Establishment of the EBCMB will restore and preserve the unique wetland functions and values associated with a functioning BLH system. Re-establishment,  rehabilitation and preservation of aquatic functions and wetland vegetation at the EBCMB would provide compensatory wetland mitigation for unavoidable, permitted losses of similar wetland habitat types in the bank’s service area. Widespread residential/commercial development is ongoing in St. Tammany Parish. Oil and gas exploration, federal hurricane protection projects, local and state government projects, as well as continued residential/commercial development are planned in St. Tammany Parish and the entire Lake Pontchartrain watershed. Many of these projects will require compensation for wetland loss or impacts.   Project Goals Proposed activities to meet the goals and objectives for EBCMB are aimed to restore wetlands where most functions have been degraded by prior land use management and to preserve existing wetland functions and values. Specifically, the project goals for EBCMB are to rehabilitate and preserve in perpetuity the physical, chemical and biological functions of a BLH wetland habitat. The EBCMB will produce wetland mitigation “credits” as a result of the re-establishment, rehabilitation, and preservation work . These credits can be used as compensatory mitigation for permitted unavoidable wetland impacts to similar wetland habitat types in the bank’s service area associated with USACE permits through Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. The existing land uses and proposed mitigation types within both properties are summarized in Table 1 .  Table 1.

Benefits of the proposed wetland restoration include water quality improvement through water filtration and sediment reduction in wetlands and streams, prolonged hydro-periods and floodwater retention, and increased biological productivity and diversity. Improved water quality would also benefit the Lake Pontchartrain watershed. The following restoration objectives are proposed   Restore natural surface and groundwater hydrology by backfilling all interior ditches with their associated spoil on the west property to promote overland sheet flow and restore wetland hydrology to 2.6 acres of cutover upland hardwoods  Replant 0.5 acres of target hardwood species where ditches were filled and throughout the 88.2 acres of cutover pine on the west property  Replant 0.7  acres of target hardwood species within the roadway on the east property  Preserve 3 4.8 acres of mature BLH habitat on the east property  Preserve 3.6 acres of upland hardwood habitat on the east property as an upland buffer  Provide long-term maintenance to prevent colonization of noxious and invasive species  Ensure long-term viability of the project by employing an adaptive management strategy and taking any corrective actions as dictated by restoration project  Monitor at a frequency and intensity to determine if plan modifications are needed to meet performance standards  Improve water quality, promote sediment retention, and reduce non-point source pollution runoff by removing the area from potential residential and commercial development  Provide long-term protection through the execution a conservation servitude to ensure perpetual existence of the EBCMB  East Bedico Creek Mitigation Bank  6    3.0   ECOLOGICAL SUITABILITY OF THE SITE/BASELINE CONDITIONS This section describes the ecological suitability of the site to achieve the objectives of the proposed mitigation bank, including the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the bank properties and how th ey will support the planned types of aquatic resources and functions , as stated in 33 CFR 332.8(d)(2)(vii)(B).  This section provides the baseline/current site conditions on and adjacent to the proposed mitigation bank.  Historical aerial photos along with soils and hydrology figures are included to support the ecological characteristic description in the following paragraphs. 3.1 Land Use 3.1.1  Historical Land Use Historically, the area encompassing the west property was a BLH forest. The hardwoods were removed in 2005 and the entire property was bedded and planted in pines. The east property historically supported, and currently supports, a mature BLH and upland hardwood forest. Historical photos show the site conditions within the EBCMB ar eas in 2005 ( Figure 3) and 2011 (Figure 4).  3.1.2  Existing/Current Land Use Land use in the vicinity of EBCMB is mostly undeveloped forest land with scattered small (single family homes) and large (subdivisions) residential development.  Current aerial photography and field visits were used to determine the current land use on, and within a 1-mile radius of, the EBCMB areas (Figure 5).  3.2 Soils  Soils within the proposed EBCMB are diverse and are determined in large part by topographic position. In general the properties are level and very gently sloping poorly-drained to moderately well-drained loamy soils (USDA 2019). The majority of the soils within the proposed EBCMB are mapped as either Stough fine sandy loam (St) or Myatt fine sandy loam (Mt and My). Smaller areas of Prentiss fine sandy loam (Pr), Latonia fine sandy loam (Lt), and Abita silt loam (Aa) are also present ( Figure 6).    Myatt soils occur in the lowest areas (wet depressions) and have a hydric rating of 85-90%. The Stough soils occur in broad, flat terraces in a landscape with irregular, slight rises and slightly concave areas. The Stough soil officially only has a 10% hydric rating; however, most areas mapped as Stough in St. Tammany Parish are actually all or partially hydric. Based on our field delineations in St. Tammany Parish, and through discussions with USACE field biologists, this soil type should have a higher rating. Our previous delineation results in St. Tammany Parish indicate that approximately 60-80% of this soil type is typically determined to be hydric. Figure 3.

All of the west area, and a portion of the east area, are within USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 08070205. The remainder of the east area is within HUC 08090201 which designates that the proposed EBCMB lies within cataloging units 01 and 05, accounting unit 02,  and sub-region unit 07 of the Lower Mississippi  Region (Figure  7). The contributing  drainage a rea associated with the proposed mitigation  bank lies within t he Bedico Creek (28,835 acres) and Soa p and Tallow-Tchefuncta  River (27,538 acres) watersheds  (Figur e 8). The sub-drainage  area for the EBCMB consists of 2,042 acres ( Figure 9).  3.3.2 Historical Hydrology and Drainage Pattern s Historically,  the area encompassing  the propose d mitigation  bank drained naturally via gravity into East Bedico Creek or S oap and Tallow Branch and eventually  into Lake Pontchartrain (Figure  10). Ele vation  on both properties  rang e from 32 to 40 feet  North American  Vertical Datum (NGVD).  The ma jority of both prope rties occur between 37 a nd 39 feet NGVD (Figure 11). 3.3.3 Existing/Current Hydrology and Drainage Pattern s Natural hydrology  of EBCMB is somewhat  intact, with the exception  of the shallow ditches on the west property and a canal on the east  prop erty. On-site hydrology  has been altered by the presence of these shallow ditches  on the we st property and a canal that drains  a nea rby existing subdivision on the east property (Figure 12). The EBCMB properties (east and west) are hydrologically connected via twin 48 ” culverts under LA Highway 1077. 3.3.4 Jurisdictional Wetlands A wetland  delineation  of the west  property was prepa red and submitted  to the USACE, New Orleans District, Surveillance  and En forcement  Sec tion by HYDRIK.  A preliminary jurisdictional determination was issued on December 19, 2018, and is included in Appendix A . A wetland  delineation  of the east  propert y was prepared and submit ted to the USACE,  New Orleans District, Surveillance  and En forcement  Sec tion by HYDRIK.  A preliminary jurisdictional determination was issued on September 30, 2015, and is included in Appendix A . Based on the delineation efforts, it was determine d that the propo sed E BCMB supports other waters of the U.S., including wetlands (Figure 13) .    08090201 080702050809020208070204Sources Esri, HERE, DeLorme, Intermap, increment P Corp., GEBCO,USGS, FAO, NPS, NRCAN, GeoBase, IGN, Kadaster NL, OrdnanceSurvey, Esri Japan, METI, Esri China (Hong Kong), swisstopo,MapmyIndia, © OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS User CommunityFigure 7.

Bottomland forest is a forested, alluvial wetland occupying broad floodplain areas that flank large river systems. Bottomland Forests may be called a fluctuating water level ecosystem characterized and maintained by a natural hydrologic regime of alternating wet and dry periods. These forests support distinct assemblages of plants and animals associated with particular landforms, soils, and hydrologic regimes. They are important natural communities for maintenance of water quality, providing a very productive habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife, and are important in regulation of flooding and stream recharge. Bottomland hardwoods are extremely productive areas due in part to periodic flood-transported and deposited particulate and dissolved organic matter and nutrients. Bottomland forests contain a number of species which can be aggregated into specific associations or communities based on environmental factors such as physiography, topography, soils, and moisture regime (LNHP 2009).  3.4.2  Existing Plant Community The west property was historically a BLH forest; however, tree removal as part of past timber management efforts has shifted this vegetation community to a cutover pine (fallow field). Currently, the west property consists primarily of cutover pines with a few areas of cutover uplands along Highway 1077. Dominant species include water oak ( Quercus nigra ), willow oak (Quercus phellos ), red maple ( Acer rubrum ), sweet-bay ( Magnolia virginiana ), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda ), Chinese tallowtree ( Triadica sebifera ), comfort root ( Hibiscus aculeatus ), inkberry ( Ilex glabra ), meadow-beauty ( Rhexia sp.), St. Andrew's-Cross ( Hypericum hypericoides ), sweetscent ( Pluchea odorata ), lamp rush ( Juncus effuses ), and various sedges (Carex spp.). Vegetation stratification within this community is 5% overstory, 5% midstory, and 90% understory. The existing vegetation communities are presented in Figure 14 , a community overview is presented as Table 2,  and representative photographs are included in Appendix B . Vegetation communities adjacent to the west property are a combination of hardwood and mixed pine hardwood.    The east property is a mature BLH forest. Dominant vegetation consists of water oak ( Quercus nigra), willow oak ( Quercus phellos ), black tupelo ( Nyssa sylvatica ), red maple ( Acer rubrum ), loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ), yaupon ( Ilex vomitoria ), southern bayberry ( Morella cerifera ), eastern poison-ivy ( Toxicodendron radicans ), and royal fern ( Osmunda regalis ). Vegetation stratification within this community is 85% overstory, 10% midstory, and 5% understory. The existing vegetation communities are presented in Figure 14 , a community overview is presented as Table 2, and representative photographs are included in Appendix B .

St. Tammany Parish is one of the fastest growing parishes in Louisiana and in the country (St. Tammany Economic Development Foundation 2014). The proposed bank’s service area is experiencing rapid residential development and this trend is very likely to continue. It is anticipated that pipelines will be constructed across the service areas of the proposed EBCMB in the near future as the demand for domestic oil increases. A recent Times-Picayune article predicted that the southern US, including Louisiana, will see nearly $500 billion in spending on oil and gas related infrastructure over the next decade (Larino 2014). This article corroborates recent discussions with oil and gas companies that indicate the continued need for mitigation banks in the service areas related to planned oil and gas activity. Additional demand for mitigation in the service areas is also likely to come from local, state, and federal governments related to hurricane protection in southeast Louisiana. Since Hurricane Katrina there has been an increased demand for mitigation credits in the service areas related to hurricane protection and this demand is likely to continue with the construction of proposed hurricane protection levees and related infrastructure.   East Bedico Creek Mitigation Bank  22    4.0 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MITIGATION BANK  This section described how the mitigation bank will be established, as stated in 33 CFR 332.8(d)(2) (ii); the technical feasibility of the proposed  mitigation bank, as stated in 33 CFR 332.8(d)(2) (iv); and the assurance of sufficient water rights to support the long-term sustainability of the mitigation bank, as stated in 33 CFR 332.8(d)(2)(vii)(A). 4.1 Site Restoration Plan This section provides information on the proposed soils/hydrologic and vegetative work that was determined to be necessary for restoration and/or rehabilitation of the proposed properties. The Sponsor proposes to rehabilitate, re-establish, and preserve approximately 126.8 acres of bottomland hardwood forest from cutover pines, cutover uplands, ditches, and a dirt road through surface hydrology restoration and native vegetative plantings ( Figure 15 ). When studying the proposed EBCMB and surrounding property characteristics, it is highly likely that the proposed mitigation bank will be successful.  The proposed restoration activities include the restoration of surface hydrology by removal of all ditches; vegetative restoration by seedling planting; and implementation of short-term, intermediate,  and long-term management strategies. The following is an overview of the principal management activities that will be needed for restoration and maintenance of the EBCMB. 4.1.1 Soils/Hydrologic Work The remediation of some artificial features as discussed in Section 3.3.3  will result in improved wetland functions and services at the EBCMB.  Rehabilitation and re-establishment activities will be accomplished by removing all ditches, grading the beds, and  preparing the site as needed (mowing, herbicide, discing, tilling, etc.). All ditches within the west property will be backfilled with native, adjacent, onsite material. The site will then be graded to remove the beds and mechanically prepared for planting ( Figure 16 ). It is anticipated that removal of the ditches and beds on the west property will allow natural hydrology to return to the site, thus providing wetland hydrology and allowing the re-establishment of BLH to the cutover uplands. Removal of the canal on the east property is not proposed since removal could cause flooding issues in the nearby subdivision. However, the east property currently supports a large acreage of forested jurisdictional wetlands even with the canal in place. Loss of wetland hydrology within this area is highly unlikely.  Removal of the ditches on the west property will promote sheet flow to the south, reduce nonpoint source runoff, and improve water quality within the area, adjacent properties, and the Pontchartrain Basin.  Further assessments of unnatural hydrology influences will be made during the restoration process. If alterations to hydrology are significant, measures may be implemented to restore natural hydrologic conditions to the area. The anticipated schedule for hydrologic restoration activities will occur in fall 2022 . Profiles and typical cross sections are presented in Figures 17-23 .

These would include   Stabilizing disturbed soils upon completion of construction activities. Measures may include vegetated filter strips, silt fences, hay bales, seeding, mulch,  or other standard stormwater runoff control best management practices.  Revegetating exposed soils following disturbance as soon as possible. 4.1.2  Vegetativ e Work The bottomland hardwood re-establishment and rehabilitation areas will be planted using a mixture of hard-mast (70%) and soft-mast (30%) producing species in the approximate percentages detailed in Table 3 . A 70%-30% hard-mast to soft-mast mixture was chosen due to the high number of soft-mast volunteer species expected to be encountered at the site.  Seedlings will be planted on 9-foot centers and with an average density of approximately 538  trees per acre. The goal is to achieve 6 0%-80% tree/seedling cover. An overview of the habitat restoration work was presented earlier in Figure 15 .  Additionally, n o large, hard-mast producing species located within the proposed EBCMB would be removed during site preparation. Large hard-mast producing species would remain to provide a seed source for volunteer species. Planting is proposed during the non-growing season (i.e., December, 2022  – March, 2023 ). Tabl e 3.

Exotic fauna such as nutria ( Myocastor coypus) will be controlled by legal methods such as trapping, shooting, etc. The Sponsor will remain constantly vigilant for the appearance of other invasive non-native species. If any other problematic invasive or exotic species are detected, an appropriate treatment program will be developed and implemented. Mechanical and/or chemical treatment of Chinese tallowtree will be performed the first year of bank establishment. Follow-up treatments would  occur periodically as needed. East Bedico Creek Mitigation Bank  33    4.2 Technical Feasibility The work required to restore and re-establish the EBCMB is routine and feasible. The Sponsor has an extensive background in land manipulation. The Agents hired by the Sponsor have extensive backgrounds in wetlands science in general and wetland mitigation banking in particular. The relatively flat landscape and the documented presence of hydric soils imply that minimal soil work will be required for successful restoration of wetland hydrology and successful reforestation of a BLH forest. Further, the historical existence of BLH forest on the proposed EBCMB and the presence of bottomland hardwood forest adjacent to the property indicate a high potential for successful restoration of a functional bottomland hardwood forest. 4.3 Current Site Risks The property encompassing and surrounding the proposed mitigation bank is located in Ward 1 and is currently zoned as Suburban or Planned Unit Development (PUD) by the St. Tammany Parish Department of Planning and Development (2019). The Sponsors do not foresee any adverse impacts to the proposed EBCMB resulting from the continued existence and operation of the neighboring land uses. The adjacent properties consist of undeveloped forests and various subdivisions and other residential areas along Highway 1077.  There is a drainage canal located on the east p roperty flowing east which drains a nearby subdivision and over which the Sponsors have no control. The Sponsors control all other hydrologic disturbances on the EBC MB properties. There are no existing pipeline or powerline rights- of-way located within the EBC MB or any other encumbrances that would negatively affect the success or sustainability of the proposed mitigation bank.  Mortgages, Easements and Encumbrances A title opinion has been rendered to the Sponsor and will be attached to the draft Mitigation Banking Instrument (MBI). The Sponsor owns the property in fee simple title and there are no mortgages, easements or encumbrances that would affect the success or sustainability of the EBCMB. 4.4 Long-Term Sustainability of the Site Long-term viability and sustainability of the EBC MB will be ensured through active and adaptive management including, but not limited to, invasive species control, appropriate monitoring,  and long-term maintenance. No long-term structural management will be required.  The Sponsor will perform initial, interim and long-term monitoring on a schedule set by the MBI, to determine the effectiveness of implemented restoration actions, progress toward restoration objectives, and whether or not adaptive management measures need to be implemented. Adaptive measures may include control of previously undetected or new growth of invasive species, replanting of hard mast seedlings, additional hydrologic remediation actions, or other restorative activities. A long-term management plan will be included within the MBI which will be prepared subsequent to submission of this prospectus and will contain a long-term management plan and costs associated with same and will identify a funding mechanism in accordance with 33 CFR 332.7(d). A third-party conservation servitude holder will independently monitor the site for future generations. East Bedico Creek Mitigation Bank  34    5.0 PROPOSED SERVICE AREA The EBCMB will produce wetland mitigation “credits” as a result of the re-establishment, rehabilitation, and preservation work . These credits can be used as compensatory mitigation for permitted unavoidable wetland impacts to similar wetland habitat types in the bank’s service area associated with USACE permits through Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Projects impacting bottomland hardwood communities and bald cypress/ tupelogum swamps, where determined appropriate by CEMVN within the Pontchartrain Basin, could use the EBCMB to compensate for these unavoidable wetland impacts.  The primary service area for the EBCMB is the Pontchartrain Basin, as defined by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality ( see Figure 8 ). All of the west property, and a portion of the east property, are within USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 08070205. The remainder of the east property is within HUC 08090201 ( see Figure 7 ). The contributing drainage area associated with the proposed mitigation bank lies within the Bedico Creek (28,835 acres) and Soap and Tallow-Tchefuncta River (27,538 acres) watersheds ( see Figure 9 ).

All legal issues concerning the unauthorized work have been deferred.","The applicant has requested a Department of the Army (DA) authorization to develop a pond on the property for cattle, recreation, and stormwater control. The applicant developed the project to control stormwater while developing a pond. During construction, the levee impounded and slowed down the flow of stormwater which reduced erosion. Approximately 125,000 cy of native material was excavated from the north side of the levee in the area of an unnamed ditch using a track excavator, and material was then deposited to construct the levee (maximum measurements: 18-foot-high, 75-foot-wide, and 500-foot-long) in wetlands and across the unnamed ditch. The levee was built with a stormwater overflow, to allow stormwater past the levee. The new levee is allegedly damming/ponding water in the ditch up stream.

INTRODUCTION   Upper Comite Flats  Mitigation Area, LLC  (UCF) – the Sponsor and EcoSystem Renewal, LLC (ECO) - the Agent  have prepared this prospectus in accordance  with 33 CFR § 332.8(d ) (2) to establish and operate the Upper Comite Flats  Umbrella Mitigatio n Bank  (UCF -UMB ).  The bank  is a cumulative + 401.6- acre proposed  umbrella mitigation bank  comprised of 4 distinct sites/ sites to provide compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts to “Waters of the United States” authorized through the issuance of Department of the Army (DA) Permits by the U.S> Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) New Orleans (CEMVN) pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 of the rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean water Act of 1972.   The current owners of the UCF -UMB properties are Victor Womack  sites consisting of approximately 40-acre  Blackwater Site, and 106.1- acre  Joor  Site, Forbes Family Trust 99.3- acre  Milldale Phase 1  Site and Harp Family Trust 96.9 -acre  Milldale Phase 2  Site located east of Zachary , Loui siana and the Joseph Cooper  Site consisting of approximately 59.5 acres located near Greenwell Springs, Louisiana. The current owners intend to protect the UCF -UMB  project areas by granting conservation servitudes as required by the USACE -MVN.  UCF  will be the sponsor and as such will construct, operate, monitor, and manage the bank  through its Agent, ECO. The site s are in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana.   1.1 Physiography  The sites  are located in the Mississippi Valley Loess Plains Level III Ecoregion , and in the  Baton Rouge Terrace , and Southern Rolling Plains Level IV Ecoregions  (74d , 74c; Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] 2003; Omernik 1987), the South A tlantic and Gulf Slope Cash Crops, Forest, and Livestock Land Resource Region (LRR P), and the Southern Mississippi Valley Loess Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 134; Natural resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2006).  The restoration sites are  located in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain Section of MLRA 134 and is typically characterized by fertile, medium -textured mineral soils, smooth to undulating topography, and a long growing season.  Some convex areas exist  as narrow rolling intervening ridges with broad and flat interfluves.  Stream valleys are typically narrow in the upper reaches but broaden rapidly downstream and have wide, flat flood plains and meandering stream channels.  Other features include natural levees and undulating terraces and spoil banks  from the natural and artificial deepening of drainageways across the landscape.   The sites  lie within the confluence of the Amite Watershed (United States Geological Survey (USGS) Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC 08070202).  The Amite River drains to Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain.  Natural elevations on the bank sites  range from approximately 7 0 to 99 feet NAVD (Figures 4a -4d).  Portions of the Joor  Rd Site and Milldale Rd Sites  are located within the 100 -year flood zone per the Federal emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood insurance Rate Map.   The proposed umbrella bank sites consist of appr oximately + 4.2 acres of other surface waters of the US that makes up cattle ponds and drainage ways on the site s, + 361.6 acres of improved pasture, and + 35.8 acres of forested area including existing hardwood flats wetlands . The current condition s of the sites are maintained by systems  of swales through the site and the current farming and cattle raising practices in place.  A Preliminary Jurisdictional Determination was issued by CEMVN for each of the project sites Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 2 of 20  between 2019 and 2020 confirming  the extent of existing wetlands on the properties and are included as Attachment A.

PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES   2.1 Project Goals   The majority of the acreage of each site consists of pastureland  managed for the purpose of commercial cattle  production.  The goal of the UCF -UMB is the rehabilitation , re-establishment , preservation and enhancement  of bottomland hardwood and hardwood flatwood forested wetland ecosystems as described by the Louisiana  Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) Natural Heritage Program (LNHP 2009).  Existing areas of non -hydric soils and uplands will be restored along with  the forested wetlands but will be classified as restored buffers  and/or upland inclusions .  Featu res such as access trails and set aside (reserved) areas  will be maintained as non -mitigation acreage within the bank .  The UCF-UMB planned restoration activities will include plugging man -made drains and field ditches at each site which will restore more natural, historic water regime  and surface hydrology.  The UCF-UMB proposes to preserve, enhance, and restore the following wetland habitat types and acreages, as outlined below in Table 3 . The mitigation area subtotal presented below in Table 3  does not include upland acres or the existing pond s and surface waters  located on each of the sites.

The swales and bayous currently overtop and flood the adjacent pastures during high rain events or high -water events and redirect sheet water flow across some areas of the sties,  and the removal of the function of  the swale s will increase the frequency of inundation and duratio n of drawdown of the fields within the project boundaries.   The areas surrounding the bank s are primarily pasture and agricultural lands with some existing forested lands, making the proposed bank valuable for water quality and wildlife.  The vegetative an d hydrologic restoration of the site s will increase habitat for wildlife and improve water quality by filtering and eliminating agricultural discharges and reducing nutrient runoff into nearby waterways.  Existing areas of uplands will be restored along with the forested wetlands but will be classified as restored upland inclusions.  Features such as access trails and set aside (reserved) areas  will be maintained as non -mitigation acreage within the bank .  The purposes of  these are to provide wildlife openings and to  facilitate monitoring/maintenance activities associated with bank  establishment,  long- term management and continued recreational use of the property. The details of the UCF-UMB proposed bank restoration are described in Section 4.1  of this prosp ectus.   2.2 Project Objectives   The site restoration plan that is conceptually detailed in Section 4.1 is intended to increase wetland and aquatic habitat hydrological, ecological and wildlife functions.  These increased functions are defined in terms of the following project objectives  Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 5 of 20   • Increase biodiversity  by providing improvements in species movement (corridor function) and in nesting/spawning/breeding/feeding and loafing habitat.  • Provide habitat for wildlife, including threatened and endangered species  by improving habitat functions, values and utilization through the re -establishment, preservation, and enhancement of native wetland community types.  • Provide for water quality enhancement  through the re -establishment of overland flow, and uptake of nutrients from re -established, and enhanced wetland community types.  • Provide for nutrient attenuation and sediment retention by eliminating livestock    grazing on the bank . • Provide for increased flood storage  and attenuation through the remova l of internal ditching  to allow overland flow of water.    3. ECOLOGICAL SUITABILITY OF THE SITES/BASELINE CONDITIONS   3.1 Land Use   3.1.1  Historical Land Use    Based on the physiographic characteristics of the sites  and remnant natural forests present within th e region, the sites  and adjacent lands were historically deciduous forested wetlands with some upland deciduous forest.  The site historically supported floodplain forested wetland and was converted to improved pasture prior to the 1980s. The historical aerial photographs are attached as Figures 4 and 5 . Clearing of forested communities for agricultural use at the Milldale Sites  occurred prior to the first available aerial images from 1941.  Historic aerials taken at the same time of the Blackwater Site, Cooper Site and Joor Site show that these areas were mostly forested and later cleared  sometime prior to 1989.  Alterations made to these sites occurred during these time periods as well.  These alterations included the clearing of forested areas, establishment of drainage ditches, addition of drainage culverts and excavation of farm ponds. Pre -impact hydrology was primarily attributed to backwater flooding from the Taber Creek, Beaver Bayou  and Hub  Bayou  respectively , and rainfall and sheet flow.  3.1.2  Existing / Current Land Use    The major land use on UCF -UMB sites consist primarily of agricultural fields used for the grazing of cattle and hay production.  Currently the cattle on the bank sites are raised for beef production. Prior utilization included active dairy farming and milk production.  Adjacent to and within one mile of each site land uses include Mixed Forest, Forested Wetlands, Hay/Pasture, Low Intensity Developed, and Open Water.  See Figure 6  for the existing and surrounding land uses of the site.  Representative photographic documentation of the site is provided as Attachment B .   Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 6 of 20  3.2 Soils    3.2.1Bank  Site Soils   USDA GIS mapped hydric soils for East Baton Rouge Parish represent the majority of the each of the proposed mitigation sites for the UCF -UMB.  These soils mainly consist of the hydric soil series Gilbert Silt Loam, (GeA); Gilbert Silt Loam, occasionally flooded (GtA); Oprairie Silt, 0 to 1 percent slopes (OpA); Ouachita, Ochlockonee, and Guyton soils (OUA), Tou la silt loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (TuB), and Deerford Verdum complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes.  There is a small portions of the Milldale and Blackwater sites that are mapped as non -hydric  Deerford -Verdum complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes (DaA)  however  the ma jority of these areas currently contains mapped wetlands based on the Jurisdictional Determinations made for each site.  The soils for each of the sites are depicted in Figures 6a-6d .    3.2.2 Soil Descriptions     Gilbert silt loam soils (GeA, 85% hydric rating)  The USDA soil series description characterizes this series as consisting of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils formed from mixed loess and loamy sediments of late Pleistocene Age. These soils are predominately located in level or nearly level areas and depressions.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  These soils exhibit slow runoff and permeability.  A perched water table typically occurs during the winter and early spring at ground surface to a depth of 1.5 feet below the surface.  Historically, these soils series were wooded with typical bottomland hardwood species of oaks, elm, sweetgum, honey locust and pine, most likely loblolly.  These soils now occur in predominately cleared areas used for cropland or pasture lands.  Unless limed, these soils are medium to very strongly acidic in the A -horizon.   Oprairie soils (OpA, 2 % hydric rating) This soils series is described by the USDA as somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess deposits. These soils are typically located on silty upland terraces of the Pleistocene age and distribution is throughout southeast Louisiana in southern Mississippi Valley silty uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils exhibit low to medium runoff and low permeability and are used for pasture  or urban development.  Deerford -Verdon soils (DaA, 10% hydric rating) The Deerford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that are high in exchangeable sodium. These soils formed in silty Coastal Plain sediments with low sand content on late Pleistocene age terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.    Ouachita, Ochlockonee, and Guyton soils (OUA, 65 % hydric rating)  The Ouachita series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These, level to nearly level , soils are on flood plains and natural levees along streams in the Western Coastal Plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS These include the Amy, Guyton and Ochlockon ee. Guyton soils, which occur on lower flood plains, have an argillic horizon and are poorly drained. Ochlockonee soils, which occur on similar landscape positions, are in a coarse -loamy particle size class.  Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 7 of 20  3.3 Hydrology   3.3.1  Contributing Watershed    The bank  receives backwater flooding from the surrounding bayous and wetlands.  Much of this area sits in a low, flat ridge perched above surrounding swamps and other wetlands.  As such, most of the contributing hydrologic contribution is from rainfall.    The  low, flat ridge helps the area retain rainfall and does not allow for the rapid exodus of rainwater through surface runoff.  The bank  sites  are located within the Amite watershed within the Lake Ponchartrain Basin.  All drainage within the bank sites  is toward the Amite River  via its tributaries  and eventually into Lake Maurepas.  The Milldale Sites  include the head waters to Hub Bayou that drains south to the Amite River.  The Joor Site is also traversed by Beaver Bayou that also drains south to the Amite  River , and the Cooper Site is dissected by Taber Creek .  Refer to Figure 1 for the location of the restoration sites and Figure 7 for the proposed service area of the bank which depicts the hydrologic units the UCF -UMB will support.    3.3.2  Historical Hydrology and Drainage patterns    Alterations to the hydrologic function of the sites of the UCF -UMB have occurred prior to 1941 and are maintained to the present day.  Had the sites not been converted to agricultural use and pastureland, they likely would have remained forested as bottomland hardwoods and hardwood flats.  Based on the elevation obtained from Louisianan State University Dept. of Geography & Anthropology’s online Atlas Lidar resource, the historic hydrologic flow of the sites consisted of sheet flow across the sites  Figures 8a-8b depicts the LIDAR elevations of each site.  The current drainage flow of each site is depicted in Figures 9a-d.  3.3.3  Existing / Current Hydrology and Drainage Patterns    Surface hydrology in the bank  is primarily driven from precipitation and surface flow from adjacent properties.   Alterations to each of the sites natural drainage patterns have occurred through construction of ditches and swales that direct waterflow into the above -mentioned waterways or nearby offsite bayous and streams.  During p eriods of high rain events portions of each site experience flooding from overflowing swales and bayous but is drained from the site due to these alterations.   3.3.4  Jurisdictional Wetlands   The CEMVN has issued preliminary jurisdictional determinations for the four UCF -UMB sites.  The determinations were used in determining the acreage of the proposed restoration activities for each of the sites.  Please refer to Attachment B  of this document for the specific wetland acres described in the PJD for each site of the proposed bank.     Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 8 of 20  3.4 Vegetation   3.4.1  Historical Plant Community    As evidenced by surrounding, and on- site bottomland hardwood wetlands , the UCF-UMB sites will be restored predominately to the historic bottomland hardwood wetland s that likely occurred prior to being converted to agricultural use. Lower elevations of the Sites will be re -established with, elm -ash sugarberry, overcup oak -bitter pecan, and cypress botto mland hardwood forested wetlands, with a diversity of predominant species characteristic of these habitat types and species associations.   Bottomland hardwood forest s are an important habitat type within the Eastern Gulf Coastal Plain and occurred histori cally on each of the  sites.  Bottomland hardwood forests are alluvial wetlands that occupy broad floodplain areas associated with river systems.  These wetlands experience fluctuating water level ecosystem characterized by a hydrologic regime of alternatin g we and dry periods.  They are important habitats for the maintenance of water quality and provide productive habitat for a variety of flora and fauna.   As described in the LNHP Natural Communities of Louisiana , common over story  trees bottomland hardwood s, and hardwood flatwoods wetland habitats include loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda), water oak (Quercus nigra) , willow oak ( Quercus phellos ), laurel oak ( Quercus laurifolia ), overcup oak ( Quercus lyrata ), Pignut hickory ( Carya glabra), shagbark hickory ( Carya o vata ), green ash ( Fraxinus pennsylvanica ), Carolina ash ( Fraxinus caroliniana ), American elm ( Ulmus Americana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia ), hackberry ( Celtis laevigata ), American beech ( Fagus grandifolia ), southern magnolia ( Magnolia grandiflora ), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua ), red maple ( Acer rubrum ), swamp blackgum ( Nyssa biflora ), black gum ( Nyssa sylvatica ), cherrybark oak ( Quercus pagoda ), swamp chestnut oak ( Quercus michauxii ).  Within the midstory, swamp privet ( Forestiera  acuminata), planar tree, or water elm ( Planera aquatica), swamp dogwood ( Cornus foemina), mayhaw ( Crataegus opaca ), greenhaw ( Crataegus viridis ), persimmon ( Diospyros virginiana), snowbell ( Styrax Americana), elderberry ( Sambucus canadensis ), wax myrtle ( Myrica cerifera ) and in wetter areas buttonbush ( Cephalanthus occidentals ) are common.  Palmetto (Sabal minor ) can be thick in the under story.  Many species of vines are also common such as muscadine ( Vitis rotundifolia), trumpet creeper ( Campsis radicans ), and greenbrier (Smilax spp.) are also quite abundant. Important herbaceous ground cover and fern plants including netted chain fern ( Woodwardia areolata), southern shield fern ( Thelypteris palustris), royal fern ( Osmunda regalis ), spider lily ( Hymenocha llis liriosome ), trailing yellow loosestrife ( Lysimachus radicans ), lizard’s tail ( Saururus cernuus ), coastal rose gentian ( Sabatia calycina ) low spearwort ( Ranunculus pusillus ) and ironweed ( Vernonia gigantea ).  3.4.2  Existing Plant Community    Most  of the existing plant community on these sites  consists of  pasture grasses such as Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), smut grass (Sporoblus indicus), Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), dog-fennel (Eupatorium capillifolium), bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) and white clover (Trifolium repens), and the areas Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 9 of 20  of wet pasture included obligate and facultative wet species such as lamp rush (Juncus effusus) torpedo grass (Panicum repens), rusty flat sedge (Cyperus odoratus), seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens) and marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata) etc.   The existing BLH forest are dominated by willow oak (Quercus phellos), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), red maple (Acer rubrum), Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera), American elm (Ulmus americana), bitter pecan (Carya aquatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) .  The midstory and understory are dominated by holly (Ilex decidua), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), lizard’s tail (Saururus cernuus), broom -like sedge (Carex bromoides), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans ), trumpet -creeper (Campsis radicans), etc. Due to the landscape position and elevation, the transition areas between the pasture areas  and BLH forests are dominated by Chinese tallow.   3.5 General Need for the Project in this Area    In addition to providing compensation for unavoidable impacts associated with commercial, residential,  and industrial developments; the proposed bank  will serve to mitigate for potential impacts associated with linear projects such as pipelines and roadway s in the already highly industrialized and populated Lake Pontchartrain Basin.  In addition to these impacts, the CEMVN currently  has three separate projects within the Lake Pontchartrain Basin that will require BLH and bald cypress  swamp (Swamp) mitigatio n by April 2023.  The proposed  Comite River Diversion Project will require a minimum of 690 acres of BLH mitigation and is expected to be completed by February 2022.  The proposed East Baton Rouge Flood Risk Reduction Project will require a minimum of 430 acres of BL mitigation and is expected  to be complete by February 2023.  The proposed  West Shore Lake  Pontchartrain project will  require a minimum of 150 acres of BLH mitigation and a minimum  of 2,020 acres of Swamp mitigation and is anticipated to be complete in April 2023.  These three projects combined will need a minimum 1,270 acres of BLH and 2,020 acres of Swamp mitigation within the next four to five years.   Local, state,  and federal officials announced August 7, 2019 they had come up with a way to c omplete a long -discussed but never -funded plan to dredge and widen 66 miles of waterways and reduce the flooding risk along five main drainage canals in East Baton Rouge Parish.1  The state of Louisiana and the cities of Baton Rouge and Central will supply about $65 million in local matching funds necessary to tap federal dollars for the $225 million U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project. The work will begin next year and take four years to complete.   The parish’s Flood Risk Reduction Project will involve d redging, widening, and upgrading portions of Bayou Fountain, Beaver Bayou, Blackwater Bayou, Jones Creek and Ward Creek.   Development of wetland restoration sites such as the UCF -UMB bank sites  in an area of increas ing development and urbanization will provide an important resource for storm water retention and flood   Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 10 of 20  storage .  Major soil resource concerns e xist in this area due to the generally unconsolidated nature of loess sediments from which the landscape is forme d.  These concerns include water erosion, maintenance of organic ma tter content and productivity, and management of soil moisture.  Water erosion is a hazard in slop ing areas that are bare due to livestock -induced erosion and timber harvest operations.  Th ough many of the soils in the region remain wet or have a high -water table for s ome or most of the year, forested wetland restoration projects such as the prop osed bank serve to increase the amount of precipitation interception and increase flood/storm wat er retention time.  These functions serve to reduce potential erosion hazards and aid in the accumulation and maintenance of soil organic matter (carbon sequestration).   The restoration and reforestation of the bank  near larger site s of forested lands will provide benefit to various species of wildlife such as nearctic -neotropical migrant birds.  Twedt et al (1999) lists 14 forest breeding species of high concern.  The planting and management of densely spaced seedlings will provide structural diversity wit hin large forested landscapes, which is an identified strategy for recruiting breeding populations of scrub -dwelling (thamnic) and silvicolous (woodland) bird species (Twedt et al 1999; Twedt et al 2010).   4.   ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MITIGATION BANK   4.1 Site Resto ration Plan    The bank sites  will provide 168.3 acres of re -established  BLH, 149.8 acres of rehabilitation BLH, 3.4 acres of BLH enhancement , 36.1 acres of BLH preservation,  and 32.0  acres of forested upland inclusion  restoration  to compensate for unavoidable wetland impacts within the Lake Pontchartrain Basin watershed.  To accomplish this task, the Sponsor shall complete the following soils/hydrologic and habitat work.   4.1.1 Soils/Hydrologic Work    The current man -made ditch system on each  site is designed to facilitate drainage of water off the property. In order to restore wetland conditions as well as historic hydrologic characteristics, we are proposing to backfill to surround grade,  select  drain age ditches located on each site, the removal through backfilling of smaller drainageways , and the removal of culverts within the sites ( Figure s 10a-d).  These alterations will impede runoff from the property, restore the sheet flow regime, and re -establis h the historic saturated to slightly inundated hydroperiods typical of bottomland hardwood  wetlands. The hydrologic restoration plan ( Figure s 10a-d) depicts locations where hydrologic alterations are proposed.   Backfilling and blocking of minor field ditches will eliminate drainage of runoff through these conveyances off -site, thus distributing runoff more evenly across the site  and resulting in the re -creation of historic overland flow conditions. By ditch blocking, the amount and force  of the water currently Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 11 of 20  discharging from these ditches will be dispersed over a broad area, resulting in increased water storage in the on -site depressional areas and slower movement of water across the site  via overland flow, thereby increasing retention of water on -site for longer periods and providing for greater biological treatment of runoff from the site . Typical profiles for ditch backfill areas and ditch blocks are provided in Figure 11. No backfilling or ditch blocks will occur in any naturally occurring conveyance of the sites.   All hydrologic modifications  will be constructed to match the surrounding natural grade on either side of the ditches using materials currently stockpiled on -site around the man- made cattle watering ponds or existing spoil present along the ditches. Any additional materials for backfilling beyond those provided by existing on -site spoil will be scraped from the upland areas as needed.  No offsite material will be imported into the floodplain of any sites . The minor ditches t o be backfilled will also be completed to match the natural grade surrounding the ditches to facilitate sheet flow.  A Department of the Army (DA) 404 permit application for the proposed ditch blocks and backfilling of ditches will be submitted simultaneou sly with the submission of this prospectus.   4.1.2 Vegetative Work   The vegetative restoration of the UCF-UMB  will be accomplished by planting of appropriate and desirable wetland tree species typical of the targeted mitigation types ( Figure s 12a-d), contr ol of nuisance and exotic invasive species, and through natural recruitment.  After hydrologic restoration has occurred on the site vegetative restoration plantings of appropriate wetland vegetation for the intended habitat type will occur during the winte r months (December, January, and/or February).  Nuisance and exotic invasive species control will occur as needed during the development of the bank, with treatments generally taking place in late summer to early fall months (August -October).  Additional d etails for each proposed habitat type are presented below.   4.1.2a Bottomland Hardwood Re -establishment and Rehabilitation   Approximately 357. 6 acres of hardwood wetlands are proposed for restoration  between each site of the UCF-UMB ( Figure 12a -d), This includes 168.3 acres of re-establishment  , 149.8 acres of  rehabilitation , 36.1 acres of preservation, and 3.4 acres of enhancement.  The existing pasture ditches will be backfilled and leveled to allow for appropriate ground elevations for the establishment of appropriate hardwood wetland species ( Table 4 ) and associated hydrophitic herbaceous species. The ditch blocks that will occur on the  sites of the bank will similarly be leveled to match surrounding ground elevations to allow for the estab lishment of wetland species on the earthen ditch blocks.  Additional site preparation and plantings for vegetative restoration are outlined below   • Prior to planting, the sites will be prepared as needed (burning, subsoiling, mowing, disking, or herbicide application) to facilitate planting. To the maximum extent practicable ruts shall be removed in order to restore natural surface contours. Resultant ground elevations will be appropriate for the establishment and maintenance of wetland  vegetation.  Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 12 of 20   • Restora tion activities  will be through  planting  an appropriate  species mixture characteristic  of Hardwood  Flatwood  and Bottomland  Hardwood  Forest  community  types  during  the planting season  from December  to February.   • Seedlings will be planted on 9 -foot centers for an initial stand density of at least 538 seedlings per acre. The anticipated schedule for planting is the 2021 -2022 planting season. A mixture of at least 60 percent hard -mast and a maximum of 40 percent soft -mast -producing commercially available species identified by a registered forester or biologist as having a high probability of survival will be selected and planted from the species list outlined in Table 4 . Bald cypress will also be utilized for planting, as commercially available, within the pond areas.   Major species’ associations typical of wet hardwood flatwoods, and bottomland hardwood community types and their topographic position are the basis for the suggested planting zones outlined in Table 5. The topographic positions of the various proposed planted species are intended to mimic the natural landscape, composition and spatial distribution associated with each species’ physiology as well as their saturation/inundation preference for this region. S ound guidelines for restoring bottomland hardwood forests authored by Allen et al. (2001) were published through the United States Geological Survey technical report series and were recently revised in 2004. This guidance was referenced for determining spe cies placement per topographic zone relative to their flood/saturation tolerance.   Determination of species and planting zones were also based on community descriptions for bottomland hardwood wetlands, and wet hardwood flatwoods from the Natural Communiti es of Louisiana electronically published by the LDWF and LNHP. Species composition for planting will be chosen from those species listed below in Table 4 . Planting zone establishment on each bank, as well as planting zone acreage calculations and plant qua ntities per species will be developed and presented during the creation of the mitigation work plan for the Mitigation Banking Instrument (MBI).    Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 13 of 20        4.1.2b Bottomland Hardwood Enhancement   The UCF-UMB Cooper Site contains approximately 1.5  acres of currently wooded  area along the banks of Taber Creek that contains some exotic species such as Chinese tallow .  Minimal to no earth work will occur in this area to avoid impacts to any desirable vegetation present.  This area will be cleared of nuisance/exotic vegetation such as Chinese tallow and interspersely planted with appropriate bottomland hardwood wetland sp ecies ( Table 4 ).  4.1.2c Bottomland Hardwood Preservation   There are approximately 36 .1 acres within the Milldale Phase 1 & 2  Sites  that are currently forested bottomland hardwood and hardwood flats and are proposed for preservation ( Figure 12a -d).  These areas consist of mature hardwood species with land elevations that will support the existing habitat type after hydrologic restorat ion of the UCF -UMB  site occurs.  These areas are largely clear of nuisance/exotic vegetation.  However, if identified in these areas, undesirable and nuisance/exotic vegetation will be cleared to reduce competition with desirable species.  Efforts will be made to limit and/or exclude mechanical work within this portion of the site to avoid impacts to the current conditions of the area.

These upland areas total 32. 0 acres between the Blackwater , Cooper, and Joor  Sites  of the proposed UCF -UMB and will be  planted with species from Table 4  with a wetland indicator status of FAC or FACU.  This area will include the planting of FACU species such as white oak ( Quercus alba).    4.1.2e Planting Zones and Species Associations   Table 5 lists the dominant and subdominant hardwood species and associates that will be planted, as commercially available, within each planting zone . Hardwood species that are better adapted to prolonged inundation or have a higher tolerance to greater flooding frequency will be plante d within the elm -ash-sugarberry and overcup oak -bitter pecan zones bordering the natural drain and within the current wetland areas on the south end of the property. Species that thrive best in semi -permanently to permanently inundated and or saturated conditions such as bald cypress will be planted within the re-graded surface water pond areas within the cypress planting zone.  Planting zone locations and acreage establishment will be developed within the mitigation work plan of the MBI.

Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 15 of 20   • Tree Species Composition Approximately 60% hard mast to 40% soft mast ratio shall be planted.   • Planting requirements To the extent possible, one to two- year old seedlings grown from locally acquired seed will be used. Seedlings will be stored and handled appropriately and will be planted during the non -growing season (December 15 to March 15).   • Site Management Following Planting a) Competing vegetation in the immediate vicinity of seedlings will be controlled, as needed, using chemical and/or mechanical means, for the first two years following planting. b) Chemical and/or mechanical control of nuisance or exotic invading noxious tree and shrub species, such as Chinese tallow, Chi nese privet, Baccharis halimifolia (salt bush), locust and black willow shall be undertaken on an ongoing basis after planting but may be discontinued when the planted community reaches an appropriate stage of development.     4.2 Technical Feasibility   The con struction work required to develop the proposed bank  is based on experience and currently accepted restoration  methods and is technically feasible.  The construction work for the bank sites  will consis t of 1) site preparation (invasive and exotic species c ontrol) , 2) dirt work, and   3) reforestation.  The relatively low landscape position and the presence of hydric soils indicate that minimal soil work will be required for successful restoration of wetland hydrology and forested wetlands in the areas curren tly being used as cattle and hay pastures .  The existence of forested wetlands within and adjacent to the bank  also suggests a high potential for successful restoration.  Once artificial drainage modifications are rendered ineffective through restoration efforts, a more natural, historic water regime will be restored.   Each site will have its own construction schedule and corresponding release schedule based upon achievement of defined performance standard for each site .  The approach of utilizing different site s within an umbrella banking instrument allows a more efficient flow and flexibility to complete these projects and minimize risk with regard to logistical issues such as equipment and labor availability; seedling availability and weather- related factors which can affect the timing of construction on a large scale.  Any phasing plans for a given site  will be further identified in the Mitigation Work Plan of the MBI.    4.3 Current Site Risks   Because of the UCF-UMB  location  and proximity to rapidly developing communities such as the cities of Central and Zachary  there is the immediate threat of conversion of the property to a more intensive land use such as  residential or commercial development  on the sites.  Existing agricultural and conservation land uses on adjacent properties are  expected to continue.  The proposed use of the UCF -UMB for wetland restoration and conservation purposes is consistent with existing, adjacent land uses.

Known powerline or natural gas line right of ways that transect t he site that would need to be excluded from the restoration activities  are shown on the respective individual Mitigation  Type Map, Figures 12a through 12 d .    4.4 Long- Term Sustainability of the Site   The proposed hydrologic restoration at the UCF -UMB is self -sustaining with inspections of the hydrologic modifications of the sites being performed on a regular basis in conjunction with vegetative monitoring activities.  Any repairs to these modifications  that may be required will be performed immediately after discovery to ensure the integrity and the successful functioning of the restoration effort .  Water monitoring devices or piezometers will be placed within the project site to monitor the water reten tion of the restored areas and ensure that the hydrology of the site is developing as intended.  The location of these gauges will be chosen, with consultation of the IRT, and installed prior to vegetative restoration of the site.  Periodic treatment of nu isance/exotic species will occur to ensure the site is meeting the performance measures required in the UBI.    5.  PROPOSED SERVICE AREA    The UCF -UMB sites are  located within the Amite River Basin USGS 8 -digit hydrologic cataloguing unit (HUC 08070202).  Th e proposed service area ( Figure 7) was determined using a watershed and ecoregion approach per existing DEMVN policy in the recently published Louisiana Rapid Assessment Method 2.0 (LRAM).  When considering offsets to bottomland hardwood, bald cypress/tupe lo swamp and pine flatwoods savannah, the CEMVN utilizes the Louisiana watershed basins, as defined by the LDEQ source data (LOSCO, 2004).  The UCF -UMB  location within the Amite River Basin  HUC falls within the LDEQ -defined Ponchartrain  Watershed.   6.

The principals, members, and managers of UCF  and Ecosystem Renewal, LLC have extensive experience in environmental services, ecological restoration, engineering, construction, silviculture, and business management.  EcoSystem Renewal, to date, has restored over 1,000 acres of bottomland hardwood wetlands in the form of both mitigation banks and large permittee-responsible mitigation areas, and created and maintained four sites within the New Orleans district under the Zachary Umbrella Mitigation Banking Instrument that have reached interim success criteria, long -term success criteria,  and are approaching their long -term credit releases. EcoSystem Renewal also currently manages and operates two bot tomland hardwood banks in the Vicksburg District --Missouri Loop and Shreveport Mitigation Banks. Ecosystem Renewal currently has one other bottomland hardwood and stream bank in process in the USACE Galveston District. EcoSystem Renewal designed, permitted , and constructed the 1,980-acre Gulf Coastal Plains Wetland Mitigation Bank (GCPWMB) just north of East Bay and south of Winnie, TX. The GCPWMB is the  first coastal prairie and tidally influenced intermediate/brackish marsh and freshwater marsh mitigation  bank permitted and operating in the USACE Galveston District USACE.      Upper Comite Flats Umbrella Mitigation Bank   April 30, 2021  Prospectus   Page 18 of 20  6.3 Proposed Long -Term Ownership and Management Representatives   UCF will serve as the sponsor represented by its agent, EcoSystem Renewal, LLC.  Each property owner of the five UCF- UMB b ank sites  will be the long-term owners of their respective properties. However, the Sponsor may appoint a long-term steward if such appointment is approved by the IRT. The anticipated long- term management will consist of monitoring, invasive species control, forest  management, boundary maintenance, and site protection.    6.4 Site Protection   The UCF-UMB will be protected in perpetuity by a Conservation Servitude held by a non -profit  conservation group (pursuant to the Louisiana Conservation Servitude Act, R.S. 91271 et. seq.) on the entirety of the restoration sites. A copy of the Conservation Servitude will be filed in the real estate records of the Mortgage and Conveyance Office of the respective Parish the property is located within and shall be provided to the USACE for review and approval prior to filing.  The proposed holder of the servitude is US Land Conservancy, LLC. After filing, a copy of the r ecorded Conservation Servitude, clearly showing the book, page, and date of filing, will be provided to the USACE.   6.5 Long-Term Strategy   Long- term management will consist of monitoring, vegetation management, invasive species control, boundary maintenance, site protection, and the funding of such activities.  The forest will be managed to maintain or increase the biological, chemical,  and p hysical wetland functions and to achieve and maintain the desired forest conditions, which will provide forested habitat capable of supporting populations for priority wildlife species .  A long -term management plan will be included with the Draft Mitigatio n Banking Instrument, which will detail long- term management needs and costs, and identify a funding mechanism. The Sponsor or Long -term Steward will be responsible for protecting lands contained within the UCF-UMB in perpetuity. An interest -bearing long -term management account will be established to ensure adequate funding is available to cover the costs of these activities in the future.

Letters must reference the applicant’s name and the subject number, be addressed and mailed to the above address .   Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria    The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest .  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood haz ards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.  To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.  Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the Na tional Environmental Policy Act.  Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.    The New Orleans District is unaware of properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places near the proposed work.  The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.  Issuance of this public notice solicits input from the St ate Archeologist and State Historic Preservation Officer regarding potential impacts to cultural resources.     Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.    Utilizing the Information & Planning Consultation for Endangered Species in Louisiana (IPaC ), dated January 27, 2020, between the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, New Orleans and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services Office, the Corps has determined that the proposed activity would have no effect on any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of the Interior.    This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of N/A  acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.  Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

INTRODUCTIONSt. Gabriel Wildlife Refuge and Mitigation Bank, LLC (SGWRMB  or Bank) is both Owner and Sponsor of the proposed mitigation bank of the same name. This Prospectus will govern the administration and management of the SGWRMB  in accordance with 33 CFR § 332.1 et seq. The Bank is a 235.09-acre tract in Ascension Parish, Louisiana  (Figure C1), that will provide compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts to “Waters of the United States,” and, more specifically, Cypress-Tupelo Swamp (CTS) and Bottomland Hardwood (B LH) wetlands as authorized through the issuance of Department of the Army (DA) Permits by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) New Orleans District (CEMVN) pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1972. The Owner will protect the Bank by granting a perpetual conservation servitude over the entire tract as is discussed below (Section 7.4.). The Owner will be guided by the Interagency Review Team (IRT), composed of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers New Orleans District (CEMVN), Region VI of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA ), and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) during all phases of construction, operation, monitoring and management of the Bank. 2. PHYSIOGRAPHY AND BANK LOCATION2.1  PHYSIOGRAPHY  The Bank i s located i n the ‘Bluff Swam p,’ a porti on of the Mississi ppi River Alluvia l Valle y that, under natura l conditi ons would ha ve flooded in mos t years from the Mississi ppi River, t he channe l of which i s now 7.4 mile s to the west. Plugging of Bay ou Mancha c where it leave s the Mississi ppi Rive r in the early 19 th Century ende d this connection for t he Spanish La ke Basin, of which th e Bluff Swamp basin is the easternmos t portion. Bluff Swamp formed in a Mississippi River channe l meander scar tha t was filled over a period of 2,000 yea rs by river sediment s and organi c swamp deposit s as the river migrate d to the west and periodically crevassed int o the Spanis h Lake Basin. Fisk (1944) show s this meander abutting and eroding the edge of a Pleistocene Loess Terrace that rises 20 to 30 feet higher on the eastern margin of Bluff Swamp (Figure C2). The geological map identifies Bluff Swamp as a “Rim Swamp” which includes the lowest elevation wetlands in the Spanish Lake watershed, with most below the 4-foot contour. The land gradually rises south and west toward the natural levee of the encircling Mississippi (Figure C3), so that the Cypress-Tupelo Swamp (CTS 126.43 acres) habitat is on eastern side of the Bank, while the Bottomland Hardwood Forest (BLH 108.66 acres) is the northern extension of Vincent Ridge and the east side of  Alligator and Braud Bayous (Figure C4). The CTS is primarily growing on Fausse Association (FA) soil (Figure C5), while the BLH is largely on Sharkey Clay  (Sc).  The CTS in the Bank is very old containing hundreds of very large, old-growth cypress trees(>800 years), including many with the sell portion of the trunk buried.  Prospectus  SGWRMB 2 Bluff Swamp wa s separated from t he rest of the Spanish La ke basin in the 1950s by construction of the Alligator Bayou/Braud Cana l levee and t he Frog Bayou Loc ks (sluicegate ). The Ascension Parish governme nt did thi s to ensure that the Prairievill e and Bluff Road communitie s to the east and south, respectively, could continue to drain into Bluff Swamp even when the rest of the Spanish Lake basin was full. The Agents  oversaw installation in 2008 of the three controllable 42-inch pipes that constitute the EPA Lock to provide more management flexibility to enhance CTS and BLH habitat quality throughout the Bluff Swamp, but particularly for those of the Bank. Several small shallow streams or swales, with minor natural levees, extend from south to north in the swamp. They once discharged to Bayou Manchac, and remain important for hydrologic connectivity in the swamp during low water periods. During higher water periods in the wetlands, flow moves over the banks and overland.    The Bank is near the southern margin of the ‘Amite’ USGS HUC 8 (8-digit 08070203) Watershed near its southern boundary (Figure C6). The entire Spanish Lake Basin and the natural levee of the Mississi ppi River i s included in th e ‘Braud and Alligat or Bayou Sub-watershe d’ (HUC 14) but t he Bluff Swamp and t he smal l portion of t he terrac e that it drains in the Prairievill e area amount to only 5,285 acres. The 3,062 acres of terrace provides runoff via small streams into the 2,960 acres that make up Bluff Swamp (Figure C7). So, the upland watershed is roughly the same size as the receiving wetland basin. The St. Gabrie l Wildli fe Refug e and Mitigation Bank take s up about 10 perce nt of the area of Bluff Swamp, but is surrounded by other protected land. 2.2  PROPERTY LOCATION  The Property i s located a t latitude 30°18.139’ N a nd longit ude 91°0 1.004’ W (approximate center point) in Ascension Parish, Louisia na (Figur e C1), near t he Ibervill e Parish lin e on the west side, and Eas t Baton Rouge Parish to t he north. It include s 235.09 acre s more or les s of jurisdictional wetla nds on a portion of t he Weste rn half and Southeas t quarter of Section 33, T8S, R2E. T he Bank property i s reached from Baton Rouge by followi ng Highland Road (L A 42) south unde r Interstate 10 (I-10) to a ri ght turn on Old Perki ns Road (L A 427) toward Prairieville.  A second ri ght is made after 2 miles at the first traffic light onto Bluff Road. This road crosses the I-10 again. A third right turn is made at bottom of overpass  onto Alligator Bayou Road (Figure C1).  This road winds for about a mile down off a higher terrace onto a causeway (levee) built along the south bank of Bayou Manchac, passing over the existing Frog Bayou Sluice Gate and the future site of the newly permitted Fish Bayou Sluice (Figure C7). Water access with a boat - pass the Alligator Bayou Tour Center and cross Alligator Bayou and turn left into the Alligator Bayou Boat Launch (30°19’15”N, 91°1’16”W) continue down Alligator Bayou to the private pier approximately 3700 feet on east side of Alligator Bayou (30°18’41’N, 91°1’15”W).  Vehicle access - turn left into a private gravel parking lot with a wooden building (former Alligator Bayou Tour Center) (30°19’18”N, 91°11’2’W) just before reaching the recently rebuilt Alligator Bayou Locks, which also pass under the road. In a 4WD or ATV, the owner will convey visitors on the levee road south along the east bank of Prospectus  SGWRMB  3 Alligator Bayou for 3,700 feet through the Spanish Lake Wildlife Refuge and Botanical Gardens to reach the northernmost point of the Bank at the Section line where three gated 42-inch pipes, collectively known as the “EPA Locks,” pass through the levee. The west bounda ry road meander s southwest from the EPA Locks atop the Alligator Ba you levee for approximatel y 3,783 feet , and then continues to follow the levee due south along the Braud Canal an additional 2,777 feet (Figure C1). 3. PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES         SGWRMB, LLC (Owner), as the owner in fee title, will record a conservation servitude for 235.09  acres in the Bluff Swamp Watershed at the Bank. SGWRMB (Sponsor) will continue to implement habitat improvements originally begun in 1994 when this acreage was first approved as a   mitigation bank.  SGWRMB, LLC  will implement mitigation improvements, including  continued      enhancement of the BLH (10 8.66 acres) and TCS habitat (126 .43 acres) by carrying out recommended timber-stand  improvements through control of invasive tree species utilizing mechanical and/or chemical means (Tables 1a and 1b).  Table 1b specifically lists 14.12 acres of the property not included in this Prospectus  that is in the Spanish Lake Watershed .   Specifically, the project objectives are to improve and protect the physical, chemical and biological functions of a forested wetland system as follows  •Ensure long-term viability and sustainability of the Bank through activeand adaptive management including, but not limited to, invasive  treespecies control, appropriate monitoring;•Ensure long-term water quality treatment of upland runoff through forestedwetlands;•Establish financial assurances to achievement of long-term success  criteria;•Ensure long-term viability and sustainability by implementing specificmanagement strategies such aso active and adaptive managemento establishment of financial  assurances and long-term  fundingmechanismso initial, intermediate, and long-term monitoringo initial, intermediate, and long-term maintenanceo initial, intermediate, and long-term invasive treespecies control;•Restore forested habitat through natural  reforestation  of existing  diverseindigenous forest species and active control of invasive/noxious tree species aswell as monitoring ;Prospectus SGWRMB •Natural regeneration of the existing  forest and prote ction of the  landsurrounded by large, ext ant, and cont iguous forest ed habitat whi ch benefi tsbreeding birds in accordance  with exist ing bird  conservat ion plan s (2016);•Provide  for  the  long-t erm  protec tion  through  the  execution  of  aperpetual-t erm conservat ion  servi tude  and  establishm e nt of  a  long-t ermfund to  cover   annual   expenditures   associa ted   with  maint enance   andmanagem ent of the Bank;Table 1a.

The proposed SGWRMB is located in the northeast ern portion of the Spanish L ake Basin that formed as a backwa ter swamp betwe en the Pleistocene Terra ce to the east now occupied by the town of Prairi eville, and the expansive encircling natural levee ridgeof the Mississippi River to the west and south (Jones et al. 1994). Although agricultural, industria l, light com merc ial and resident ial deve lopment have been ac tively pursued on the higher l and surrounding the SLB, the ongoing flood risk has limited activities within the basin to timbering, oil and gas extract ion, and recreat ional hunting and fishing. Despi te its proxim ity to Ba ton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisi ana’s two l argest cities, the SLB remains uninhabited except by wi ldlife.  The suitability of the Bluff Swamp and the Bank to achie ve the stated obje ctives is well established as it is in relatively good condit ion today and requires limited hydrologic managem ent driven by a well-conceived monitoring program. Habitat improvement through removal and control of invasive trees and shrubs will require constant attention and adaptation year in and year out to ac hieve optimal results for planned types of aquatic resources and functions.4 5 4.1.2  Current Land Use               There was a proposal to clear-cut a majority of the acreage, but purchase of the property (1130+ acres) in 1994 and its incorporation into a mitigation bank ensured that it was not timber ed.  Approximately 901 acres were used to satisfy a Consent Decree between EPA and the Parish of Ascension.  However, the remainder of credits associated with the total acreage were neither sold nor made available to the public.  The (EPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) and the Louisiana Department of Forestry (LDF) have inspected the site. LDWF and LDF have done preliminary studies on the site and have established potential guidelines for habitat improvements.  LDWF and LDF have done preliminary studies on the site and have established potential guidelines for habitat improvements.  Adjacent wetland  use is for mitigation banks, while adjacent uplands are residential and commercial (Figure C7). 4.2  S OILS    The soil types present at the proposed Bank, as identified in the Ascension Parish Soil Survey vary slightly throughout the Bluff Swamp (Figure C5) . Generally, Galvez (Gb) silty clay loam soil is shown along the natural “oak/swamp privet” ridges which are present in portions of the basin. Galvez (Gb) soil has a woodland classification of 2W5. Fause (FA) association soils are found in large areas throughout. This association is described as 75% Fause. The remaining 25% consists mostly of Sharkey (Sf) and Barbary. The description of a representative Fause clay profile found in the Ascension Parish Soil Survey was taken from the Bluff Swamp.  Sharkey clay (Sf - frequently flooded) is found across the broad bottom areas interspersed with the Fause association. Both  Sharkey and the Fause association are in woodland classification 3W6. These are all wetland soils  with the exception of Galvez soil on the ridge crests, which occasionally flood.  Field investigations and a wetland delineation conducted in 1995 and 2019 confirmed these soil types, along with hydric  indicators.Prospectus SGWRMBThe Bluff Swamp has had pretty much its current characteristics since before the area was colonized by European settlers and enslaved Africans. The best timber was cut off the land during the 19 th Century, but hundreds of large old-growth cypress were left alive because they were hollow or deformed or otherwise not worth the cost of processing into lumber. BLH across most of the Spanish Lake Basin has been logged multiple times since settlement, continuing into the 1990s. Mature BLH trees currently within the Bank are between 50 and 150 years old. The primary uses of the Bluff Swamp have not changed over time. First, it has served as a recreational mecca for those lucky enough to have access for hunting, trapping and birding. The Agents operated a much-loved ecotourism business for more than a decade, taking school groups down Alligator Bayou and using the swamp as an outdoor classroom.Development of land within one mile of the Bank is residential, light-commercial and rural on the Pleistocene uplands around Praireville (Figure C7).  This is about a half-mile from the eastern boundary.  The Bluff Road community on the Vincent Ridge is about 1.5 miles from the southern Bank boundary.  Cypress-tupelo swamp constitutes most of the buffer area between developed land and the Bank.Prospectus  SGWRMB  6 4.3.   HYDROLOGY  4.3.2  Historical Drainage  Patterns  The property is part of an ancient backwater swamp historically fed by the Mississippi River and the Amite River Basin.  The  Spanish Lake basin would seasonally flood, distributing seeds, sediment, and attracting spawning fish .  The basin floodwaters would then flow into Alligator Bayou, Frog Bayou, and Fish Bayou, but eventually returning through Bayou Manchac to the Amite River, Lake Maurepas, and Lake Pontchartrain onward to the Gulf of Mexico.  The Alligator/Braud Bayou levee was constructed between the Bluff Swamp and Spanish Lake watershed in the 1950's, fundamentally  altering the drainage pattern. Orr (1995) found much of the Bluff Swamp to be waterlogged prior to installation of the  EPA water-control structures through the Alligator Bayou levee in 2008, with its three 42"" gated drain pipes. The existing structure at Frog Bayou is too small to efficient ly remove excess water levels within the Bluff Swamp watershed during the growing season. This led to prolonged periods of excessive water levels and inundation that were seriously affecting species composition of the bottomland hardwood forest. Debris and snags in the sloughs leading to Frog Bayou also contributed to impoundment.    4.3.3  Existing Drai nage  Patterns  The Bank lies between the northern extension of the Vincent Ridge (including Vincent Ridge) and up to the base of the Alligator Bayou/Braud Canal Levee (Figure C4). The only relief is provided by low natural levees on either side of small sloughs. Runoff enters the swamp through incised streams on the Prairieville terrace to the east that collect into a low central wetland area (Figure C7). Water also drains to a lesser degree from the crevasse ridge deposit on the south that is home to the Bluff Road community. This is where the people live who are most vulnerable to flooding, and this happens whenever the water level in the swamp rises above 8-feet (NAVD88) on the Frog Bayou gauge.   4.3.1  Contributi ng Watershed           The entire Spanish Lake Basin and the natural levee of the Mississippi River are included in the 'Braud and Alligator Bayou Sub-watershed' (HUC 14) , which is part of the much larger ""Amite River Watershed"" (HUC 8), but the Bluff Swamp and the small portion of the terrace that it drains in the Prairieville area amount to only 5,285 acres. The 3,062 acres of the terrace provides runoff via small streams into the 2,960 acres tha t make up Bluff Swamp (Figure C7).  So, locally, the upland watershed is roughly the same size as the receiving wetland basin.  The St. Gabriel Wildlife Refuge and Mitigation Bank takes up about 10 percent of the area of Bluff Swamp, but is surrounded by other protected land.Prospectus  SGWRMB  7 Hydrology in t he Bank is driven directly by precipitation on t he Bluff Swamp and its watershed on t he Prairievill e Terrace. Thi s water collect s in the swamp and slowly drai ns to the north into Ba you Manchac, or alternatively through th e EPA Lock into Alligator Ba you. In the absenc e of rainfall, excha nge can occur with Ba you Mancha c through t he Frog Bayou Lock. I t is useful at times to all ow inflow from Bayou Mancha c to avoid growth of Cutgrass, tall ow and will ow in sloughs. Ultimatel y all drainag e from the Bluff Swamp flow s through Ba you Mancha c into the Amit e River and La ke Maurepas.   a.The Parish of Ascension manages the hydrology of the Bluff Swampwatershed via two water-control structures (Frog Bayou structure and the three  42” EPA water control structure s (MV N 2007-877 CZ) in t he Bluff Swam p watershed).  Thes e structure s are mean t to help ensure that the bottomland hardwood fores t is not inundated a t key seasona l stages.   A third water-control structure, th e Fish Bayou Lock, ha s receive d a DA permi t (MV N 2018-0135-CQ) and is awaiting construction by Ascension Parish Government. The  Ascension Parish Government is responsible for maintenance and operation of all three water-control structures. The property owner/agents advocated  for installation of a recording water level gauge on their property by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the swamp near the Frog Bayou water-control structure. This gauge has made it possible to operate the Frog Bayou water-control structure for both drainage and ecological purposes. b. Hydrologic enhancement with the EPA three 42” water controlstructure  (MVN 2007-877 CZ) in the Alligator Bayou levee is used to control passage of Bluff Swamp water which drains west into Alligator Bayou, when the high water level of Bayou Manchac restricts the outflow of the Bluff Swamp watershed. The agents permitted and assisted with installation of the three 42"" gated pipes installed through the Alligator Bayou levee, placed  at the lowest point of the Bluff Swamp, enhancing the BLH  (108.66 acres) and TC (126.43 acres) in the SGWRMB (Attachment  D, photo 6). This point where the water-control structure is located is at the northern boundary of the Bank (Figure C7).  Orr (2019) notes hydrologic improvement that occurred after the additional structures were installed in 2008.  Orr (2019) notes that seedlings, saplings, and understory vegetation are denser than in the past. c. The third water-control structure permitted for Fish Bayou  (east ofFrog Bayou) (MVN2018-0135-CQ) will consist of two 12’ x 12’ gated pipes that will allow outflow from Bluff Swamp into Bayou Manchac (Figure C7). The agents have worked closely with Ascension Parish Government to obtain funding for both the EPA and Fish Bayou Locks.      d. Two new USGS monitoring stations; one to the east of the AlligatorBayou levee in the Bluff Swamp watershed 30 feet south of SGWRMB, and the second to the west of the EPA water-control structure on the west side of the Alligator Bayou levee in the Spanish Lake watershed.  These two monitors will be installed with the construction of the permitted Fish Bayou water-control structures.        4.3.4  JURISDICTIONAL WETLANDS SECTION       The entirety of the Bank with the exception of the Alligator Bayou/Braud Canal Levee has been determined by a licensed wetland delineator to meet all criteria for certification as JurisdictionalProspectus  SGWRMB  8 Wetlands.  Members of the IRT have visited the property and the CEMVN is expected to issue a preliminary jurisdictional determination (PJD) covering all acreage identified for inclusion in the Bank. Similar PJDs have previously been issued for a  number of other mitigation banks approved in the  Spanish Lake Basin.      4.4   VEGETATION  4.4.1   Historical Plant Community Plant species which were likely present on the site historically included •Live Oak (Quercus virginiana)•Water Tupelo (Nyssa aquatica)•Drummond Red Maple (Acer rubrum L. var. drummondii(Hook. &  Arn. ex Nutt.) Sarg.)•American Elm (Ulmus americana L.)•Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.)•Baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.)•Green Ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.)•Honey Locust (Gleditsia triacanthos)•Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia)•Bitter Pecan (Carya aquatica)•Sugar Berry (Celtis laevigata)•Live Oak (Quercus virgniana)•Laurel Oak (Quercus laurifolia Michx.)•Willow Oak (Quercus phellos L.)•Overcup Oak (Quercus lyrate)•Nuttall Oak (Quercus texana Buckley)•Water Oak (Quercus nigra L.)     4.4.2  Existing Plant Community Forester Pau l Orr ha s conducte d three fores t surve ys that include the Bank area, in 1996, 2014 and 2019 based on identifying counting and measuring trees on the same one-fifth acre sample plots (Figure C9). His survey approach is somewhat different from that of the delineator. The most recent survey, for example, was taken primarily to develop prescriptions for management of invasive and noxious tree species.  Orr describe s four forest types in the Bank. The first is of healthy BLH growing on natura l ridges that are floode d only duri ng extrem e rain events. T he soil type is a relativel y thin silt-loa m over a clay base . The topographi c elevati on here is caused by old distributary ridge s associated with th e crevass e to the south of th e Bank. Remna nt channel s run down the center of bot h ridges. T he over-story of thi s site is dominate d by sweet gum (Liquidambar  styraciflua ), overc up oak (Quercu s lyrata ) and water oa k (Quercu s nigra) and also includes 9 Prospectus  SGWRMB hackbe rry (Celti s laevigata), li ve oak (Quercu s virginiana ), America n elm (Ulmu s americana ), green ash  (Fraxinu s pennsylvanica ) and baldcypres s (Taxodium distichum ). The over-story is closed and dense. Diameter growth wa s moderat e to slow for the water oa ks that were bored. This is likely du e to the density of t he stand. Averag e tree size for the water oa ks and overc up oaks is 22 inche s DBH, which a re of mat ure size and age. Understory specie s include seedli ngs and saplings of water oa k, elm, sweetgum, bitter peca n (Carya aquatic ), persimm on (Diospyros virginiana ), baldcypres s and Chines e tallow tree (Sapiu m sebiferum ). Other specie s found i n the understory a re palmett o (Sabal minor ), hawt horn (Crataegu s viridis ), Chinese prive t (Ligustru m sinense ), deci duous holly (Ilex decidua ), blackbe rry (Rubus fructicosus ), greenbrie r (Smilax  sp) and French mulbe rry (Callicarpa Americana ). Palmetto dominate s the understory in many places. Fora ge for wildlif e is very good and include s abunda nt acorns from the oak species.  The second forest type identified by Orr (2014) is a medium elevation BLH (Figure C9). It is flooded seasonally but is dry for extended periods when rainfall is low. The soil is a heavy clay. The presence of large old-growth baldcypress is evidence that this area was once a cypress swamp that has received significant influxes of sediments that have raised the overall elevation. The area is dominated by overcup oak and hackberry. Nutall oak (Quercus nuttallii) is present but in much smaller numbers than overcup oak. Other co-dominant trees include green ash, baldcypress, bitter pecan, red maple (Acer rubra var. drummondii), American elm, honey locus t (Gleditsi a triacanthos ) and water oak. T he canopy i s mostly close d and dens e with scattered openi ngs caused by blow-downs. T he oaks are growing slowly. T he avera ge diameter of the overc up oaks is 16-inche s DBH, but thes e are mature trees. T he understory include s seedlings and sapli ngs of hackbe rry, baldcypress , nuttal l oak, red maple, el m and tall ow tree. Palmetto, swamp prive t (Forestier a acuminata ) and wate r elm (Planer a aquatica ) are also prese nt in the understory. T he underst ory is pretty open bu t with thicket s of swamp prive t and water elm covering approximately 20 perce nt of the area. Forag e for wildlif e is fair as acorns from the overc up oaks are abundant. Orr (2014) also described as a third type a low-elevation BLH that could also be described as a marginal cypress swamp (Figure C9). The land is flooded up to four feet deep for extended periods. The soil is a heavy clay muck. This zone has a number of old-growth baldcypress scattered throughout with second-growth baldcypress also numerous. The dominant stand is green ash and black willow. Overcup oak, hackberry, Nuttall oak and American elm are also present in the overstory, but the overstory is not closed. Instead, thickets of swamp privet and water elm cover about 40 percent of the area. Growth of the relatively sparse oaks was moderate to slow, and conditions seem better for baldcypress and tupelo gum (Nyssa aquatica) than for BLH species. The understory has a few seedlings and saplings of green ash, hackberry and tallow tree. Water locust ( Gladitsia aquatica) and buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) are present in some open areas. Finally, Orr (2014) describe s the lowes t land of all, tha t dominated by baldcypress, what would clearly be called CTS, but tupelo gum tree s are surprisingly rare. T he land sta ys wet almos t all the time and fl oods up to six fee t seasonally. T he soil is clay muck with a significant organi c component. Black will ow is prese nt but in relatively l ow numbe rs along wit h a few green Prospectus  SGWRMB  10 ash, overcup  oak and water locust. The canopy is thin in most areas except in scattered second -growth  baldcypress  stands. A relatively small number of old -growth  baldcypress  contribute significantly to the canopy. Large ar eas of understory thickets cover much of the area composed of buttonbush, swamp privet and water elm.        4.5  GENERAL NEED FOR PROJECT  The Bank will provide compensation for unavoidable impacts associated with commercial, residential and industrial developments in the rapidly developing area immediately surrounding the Spanish Lake Basin. The Bank can also serve to mitigate for potential impacts associated with linear projects such as pipelines and roadways in the already highly industrialized and populated Lake Pontchartrain Basin. In addition to these impacts, the CEMVN currently has three separate projects within the Lake Pontchartrain Basin that will require BLH and CTS mitigation by April 2023. The proposed Comite River Diversion Project will require a minimum of 690 acres of BLH mitigation and is expected to be completed by February 2022. The proposed East Baton Rouge Flood Risk Reduction Project will require a minimum of 430 acres of BLH mitigation and is expected to be complete by February 2023.  The proposed West Shore Lake Pontchartrain project will require a minimum of 150 acres of BLH mitigation and a minimum of 2,020 acres of CTS mitigation and is anticipated to be complete in April 2023. These three projects combined will need a minimum of 1,270 acres of BLH and 2,020 acres of Swamp mitigation within the next two to three years .5. ESTABLISHMENT OF A MITIGATION BANK5.1  SITE ENHANCEMENT PLAN The Owner will, in collaboration with Ascension Parish Government, seek to improve the ecological benefits of water management in the Bluff Swamp. This will be accomplished primarily by reducing the duration of periods when runoff is ponded and stagnant on the land to no more than two continuous weeks. This effort will be particularly targeted at improving conditions in the Type 3, low-elevation BLH described above (Figure C8). Hydrology is recognized as an important component of the enhancement plan, though not the main focus. Construction of the EPA Lock as well as the anticipated installation of the Fish Bayou Lock has given the agents confidence that they will be able to provide an improving capacity t o boost desireable tree growth rates and habitat quality in both BLH and CTS stands. But the main focus of this work plan is to address the degradation of the swamp by exotic and invasive understory species that severely inhibit recruitment and growth of young BLH co-dominants and reduce habitat quality for wildlife  Prospectus  SGWRMB  11 5.2  TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY  The construction work required to develop the proposed Bank is based on experience and currently accepted restoration methods and is technically feasible. The sold -out Bayou Paul Bank and the Spanish Lake Restoration Banks are adjacent and/or within the same b asin to the SGWRMB. The existence of forested wetlands within and adjacent to the Bank also suggests a high potential for successful restoration. Once invasive tree -species removal is undertaken, a more natural, historic forest will be enhanced.  5.3  CURR ENT SITE RISK Potential Long -term Management Issues  Possible issues  Possible causes  Potential response  Responsible  party  Damage to trees  Vandalism  Patrolling area and put posted signs every 500 ft. on perimeter  Sponsor  Inadequate timber -stand improvement by injection  Treatment failure  Retreat  Sponsor          The Owner is not aware of adverse impacts to the Bank that might result from a continuation of existing land uses within the watershed. Development in the Prairieville area will increase impermeable surfaces and increase runoff volume relative to precipitation. The region has experienced an increase in the intensity of rainfall events due to climate change. Both of these factors point to the importance of building the much larger Fish Bayou Lock.5.4  LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THE SITE Long-term viability and sustainability of the Bank will be ensured through active and adaptive management including, but not limited to, invasive species control, appropriate monitoring, and long-term maintenance. 6.
