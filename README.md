# usace_scraping

## Overview

This project scrapes public notices in PDFs from the [US Army Corps Engineers website](https://www.usace.army.mil/) and extracts fields from unstructured PDFs into a tabular table, building a data pipeline for a dashboard managed by Atlas Public Policy to analyze the impact of oil and gas projects on wetlands 

This project is underdevelopment.
