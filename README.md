### Overview

This project scrapes public notices in PDFs from the US Army Corps Engineers website and extracts fields from unstructured PDFs into a tabular table, building a data pipeline for a dashboard managed by Atlas Public Policy to analyze the impact of oil and gas projects on wetlands

This project is underdevelopment.

### Structure of the Repo

* __rss_feed_scrap_replicate.ipynb__: The testing script for New Orleans. The work will move to scraping_districts going forward.
  * __Instruction for running the notebook__: The error messages and scraping results will be automatically recorded in a Google Sheet for troubleshooting, so running the codes will open up a credential page for users to log in. Please log in and authorize the connection. A token file will be automatically generated when running the codes and enable users to reaccess Google Sheets without logging in.
  * __Google sheet__:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VYcmSCuvBMiRRpUusuulIcS4kjkXrTuFZLfKOV_IxkE/edit#gid=0. Google sheet has 5000-character limitation for each cell, so will export output directly in .csv. Please let me know if you have any problems accessing the sheet. (email: xz531@georgetown.edu)
* new_orleans.csvï¼š The output of rss_feed_scrap_replicate.ipynb for field validation.
* __scraping_districts__: Improved functions for easy replication for all districts and customized codes for each district
* env: dependencies
